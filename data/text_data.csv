On Rover, pet parents can easily discover, book, and manage personalized care for their dogs including pet sitting, dog walking, and doggy day care. Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.

We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies.

For the past three years we have been nominated as one of Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" by Seattle Business Magazine, and celebrated awards in 2016 and 2017 by Seattle Met magazine and the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're also the recipient of World’s Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)—we love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.

Who we're looking for:

We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to tackle a broad array of problems and work in a fast-paced, collaborative startup environment.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?

At Rover we obsess over our customers’ needs, relying heavily on data to improve the customer journey, and to continuously optimize outcomes in our marketplaces.

In other words, you know where the sharp edges are, and can lead decisions around what techniques are and are not appropriate to employ for particular classes of problem
You’re a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a dog sitter and a dog owner on the Rover platform.
You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions

About you
Seeking an independent self-starter, critical thinker, data explorer and solutions-oriented travel demand modeler with a passion for service excellence and continual learning. Maybe you're a senior modeler who takes pride in your ability to look at a problem and reverse engineer a solution and you're looking to bring your experience to a large organization that offers something ""different"" or new. Or perhaps you're just starting out in your professional data science career and want the opportunity to apply an innovative, equity-focused approach to projects that impact our communities in a meaningful way while getting the chance to blaze your path in the career you've always desired. Wherever you may be in your career, prepare to learn and be challenged. If you think you're the one we've been looking for, we want to know more about you.

About us
The Modeling and Forecasting Services Division lives within the Research Center department at Metro. We are a nationally recognized group that is well known for our travel demand modeling expertise and innovative approaches to problem solving. We build and maintain custom modeling and forecasting tools that provide information to help our communities and residents make data-driven decisions. Here are some links to our department and samples of our work in our division:
The Research Center - https://www.oregonmetro.gov/tools-partners/data-resource-center
Modeling Services Division - https://www.oregonmetro.gov/modeling-services
About the work
How might people react to road tolling? How many residents might choose to take a new light rail line? Will introducing a new bike trail change the route a cyclist might take? How will cars and trucks contribute to our air quality in the future? What impacts might automated and connected vehicles have on the transportation system? What can be gleaned from ""big data"" to track new travel patterns and choices? These are the kinds of questions our forecasters help answer with travel demand models and innovative analytic techniques that delve into emerging data sources.

Travel demand models are a collection of mathematical and statistical computer programs that simulate a ""typical"" day of travel for large metropolitan areas, such as the greater Portland region. These models can be used to replicate present day conditions as well as make projections about the future. The team of modelers at Metro works collaboratively to collect data, conduct research and analyses and develop software that seeks to continually improve and evolve Metro's modeling toolkit.

In a typical week, you may be given tasks that can be as varied as collecting, analyzing and visualizing traffic data; assisting in the development of mapping applications; coding of multimodal transportation networks; applying travel demand models; evaluating the scope and extent of off-the-shelf modeling software products from vendors; or applying machine-learning techniques to extract meaning from emergent ""big data"" resources.

The more experienced modeler may be involved in household survey analysis and the design of new cutting-edge models. You will have the opportunity to work with and support both internal and external clients. The field is ever-changing and ""on-the-job"" development of relevant skills is highly encouraged at Metro. Software programming, database development and query methods, statistical analysis, data science, econometrics and GIS will be used extensively in this work.

Application requirements
1) Electronic application, 2) answer to supplemental questions and 3) resume.

At Metro, we hire a workforce representative of the communities we serve, understanding that a diverse workforce strengthens our organization. We value diversity and support a positive and welcoming environment where all of our employees can thrive.
