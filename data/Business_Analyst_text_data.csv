They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.


BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.


Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives.

Business Analyst Job Responsibilities
If you read our business analyst job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading!

The core function of our role as business analysts at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats.

So what do all of these “hats” really mean?
Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively.
Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally.
Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.
So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.
Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!",Remote,Business Analyst,False

Our Story

Western Psychological Services (WPS) was established in 1948 in a little pink house in Brentwood, not far from the local VA hospital. Dr. Morse Manson, the company founder, developed a psychological test that would help returning World War II vets adjust to civilian life. This was the first of many psychological and educational assessments that WPS would publish over subsequent decades. Today these assessments are used by helping professionals throughout the world to evaluate, diagnose, and treat people in need—especially children and teens who have developmental, social, or behavioral challenges. WPS is known world-wide for our industry-leading autism assessments.

That’s the first part of the story: WPS is a stable, successful, family-owned company, 80+ employees strong, engaged in work that you can feel good about doing. This is a place where you can build a career—many of our employees stick around for 10, 20, or even 30+ years.

Our Latest Chapter

The second part of our story starts with Jeff Manson, grandson of the founder (and now president of WPS), who’s making a big investment in the company’s future. He’s nurturing a transformative company culture that encourages innovation, creativity, transparency, and collaboration. And, as part of his commitment to a more open work environment, he moved the company a new home in Torrance, with plenty of elbow room, state-of-the-art equipment, and lots of amenities. The idea is that employees who are happy, empowered, acknowledged, and listened to will better serve the customer and the bottom line. It seems to be working—WPS continues to do well year after year!

We're all Signifyers, so we know that what needs to get done will get done.

Signifyd is a place where no one is going to tell you how to do your job. If you want help, you'll get it — from all quarters. But we pretty much figure out what needs to be done, who's in the best position to do it and then let that person roll-up her or his sleeves and have at it.

Who believes challenges are best overcome by thinking differently.
Who knows his or her role, but isn't confined by it.
Who's greatest satisfaction comes from helping customers succeed and achieve their dreams.
Who isn't afraid to disagree, convincingly, civilly and honestly.
Who will stop and hold the door for a colleague, even if you're running late.

Oh, and a few particulars for this role:
You'll join a new team and work cross-functionally with several organizations at Signifyd (including Data Science, Modeling, Engineering, Customer Success and Sales), with the primary objective of enabling leadership to make effective, analytically driven, and strategic operating decisions.

Lead ad hoc ""consulting-style"" projects to improve metrics, data quality, and reporting processes that will support Risk initiatives. This often involves starting with a fairly open-ended problem, identifying trends and issues, synthesizing and reporting the results, proposing and developing a solution, and driving implementation.
Collaborate with other teams and leadership to define business vision, goals and strategies & execution plans
Review high-volume data to identify issues with data quality and strengthen model performance
