"ContractHere at Fooji, the food doesn't just give itself away. We've got a strong team of engineers behind the scenes managing our platform, and we want you to get in on this.
We're looking for a contract Data Scientist who has practical experience performing data mining, and who can quickly get to work on a new problem.

Obviously we will give you initial guidance, but you must be able to go away and come back with statistically significant findings. We are not expecting you to do the impossible: if you can prove that certain models cannot be built given the current data set, fine. This is also an interesting finding.

"About Us:
TransLoc’s mission is to help riders on public transportation reach their jobs and schools in the most equitable, accessible, informative and optimized way ever. Unlike other technology companies, we believe that public transit is central to the future of mobility and our products help agencies by bridging the chasm between today’s needs and tomorrow’s demands. Are you aligned with our mission and values? We want to hear from you!
What are we looking for?
We’re looking for the newest member of our quantitative mobility team. This team is responsible for developing and applying data and simulation tools to help our transit agency customers make data-driven decisions about how to design and improve their demand-response services. This is a unique role that combines technical data science work with frequent customer interaction. From day to day, you will work with data from multiple sources (customer, public), apply our simulation approach, write code to develop new tools, and create and present reports to share what you've learned. You will join us on the front lines of learning about microtransit alongside transit agencies, and will help us continue to develop our capability to innovate with data.
Are you...
Equally excited by talking with customers and analyzing data. This is a unique data science position that requires being comfortable communicating with a variety of non-quants in real-time conversation about data results and transit service design, as well as focusing in on data analysis and report creation.
A natural collaborator. You will work as part of a cross-functional team of data scientists, engineers, and project managers, as well as across the organization and with our transit agency partners.
Comfortable with ambiguity. We’re doing new things, and we have guidelines but no right answers. You’ll need to be able to make decisions with limited information and keep up with rapidly changing context.
Independently motivated. You thrive in a work environment where freedom comes with the responsibility to hold yourself accountable to high standards.
Mission driven. If seeing new transit services come to life and serve riders in new ways is profoundly satisfying to you, everything else is likely to fall into place.
You should have…
At least 2 years post-graduate applied experience.
A degree in a data-related discipline or in a discipline that applies quantitative analysis to understand real world systems (such as economics or urban planning).
Experience programming with data using R or python, with a willingness to use R primarily.
Preferred: Experience with transit, mobility, or urban planning. Experience with the innovative application of technology.
Pay & More:
TransLoc is a mission-driven company, committed to our people-first philosophy and high-performance work culture. We work hard, play hard, and want to nurture our employees to reach their highest potential. That's why we provide competitive compensation packages, generous benefits (ranging from medical, dental, vision and more) and a progressive work environment.

"WHO WE ARE
Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world's largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

"Not just another start-up, we fight fraud!

At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

Your day-to-day

At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too.
Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems.
The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis …
As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available.
Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve.
After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to:

Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms;
Create the associated mathematical models;
Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms;
Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models;
Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution.
Your toolkit

On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast!


Your profile

Shift Technology’s data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities.
If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology:

You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research;
You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details;
You can write quality production code;

Location:Austin
Date Opened:2018-07-30
Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
Data Scientist, EA Customer Experience
#WeAreEA and we exist to inspire the world to play. EA values creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork. We mean things like acting with curiosity, speaking up with original ideas, and committing to each other as one team.

We’re looking for all the best kinds of people to make great experiences for our players. The best people want a job that inspires them, while giving them room to enjoy their lives. And we want to give them that. We celebrate diversity and inclusion by creating a place where you can come to work and be yourself.

You’re a Data Scientist.

You know how to pull all types of data from any source, be it Facebook posts, call center chats, video likes or survey results. You understand that you have 2 basic jobs:

Help our studios understand what problems players have with their games and provide insights that help optimize our call center. Both pursue the ultimate goal of providing the World’s Best Service for the World’s Best Games.

You use all resources available to you to help solve a problem, be it a new algorithm, programming language or the person sitting next to you.

You’re a programmer/statistician/NLP expert who is fanatic about games and Customer Experiences.

You’re also a genuinely nice person who brings positive energy to an office. You’re approachable and take the time to listen so that you understand someone else’s view.

This role is part of EA’s Customer Experience organization. The Customer Experience organization strives to make EA known for taking care of its players. We’re players taking care of players and people talking to people – whenever, wherever, and however they need us.

We’re the Data Science team, part of the larger Customer Experience Insights team.
We are surrounded by Production, BI, SEO and Market Research analysts. We’re the people who use advanced statistics and modeling to help solve business problems. We surface player problems through our text analytics offerings. We write a lot of code and talk to stakeholders from all teams and all levels. We are great team mates and trusted advisors, who provide insights to facilitate decisions and create models that change experiences.

A typical day in the life of a Data Scientist:
Come into the office and catch up with your team mates about last night’s gaming session or the hottest show on TV (no spoilers until 24hrs have passed – after that: anything is fair game!)
Check on last night’s Jenkins script and add some code to a project you’re working on
Talk to one of your coworkers on the Call Center side about how to match the right advisor to the right player – this could be your next big project
Take some time back at your desk to write up any notes and make a project plan proposal
Attend a JIRA prioritization meeting to update work that’s in flight and plan for work to come
Grab coffee and read up on any stats blogs or tech news you’re subscribed to
Check out the model you deployed into production last month to see if it’s time to re-train
Pull the latest changes on an NLP model you’re collaborating on from Stash and tinker with the parameters, then chat with your peer about the results of the tweaks and make plans for what to change next
Spend a couple of hours heads down/headphones on getting series with an analysis.
Finish the day looking over any code you wrote today, knit any Markdowns and make sure your documentation is up to snuff.
So how do Data Scientists make great experiences for players? They:

Tell stories with data and interpret results for their stakeholders
Prioritize problems to solve based on the impact to the player experience while keeping overall organizational goals in mind
Have a basic understanding of EA’s games and find time to play whenever they can
Display confidence in communicating with senior management, or any audience, to ensure what they say is heard and understood
Identify and lead collaborative efforts both inside and outside of their team; working with key influencers to effect change
Tailor communications to their audience, providing either in-depth expertise or a high-level summary depending on the situation
Use models and techniques that win on performance and understandability vs. sophistication
You’ll need to be awesome at wearing these hats:

Customer Advocate – You care what kind of experience our players are having when their games or services don’t work and you want to be an active participant in improving it

Programmer – You’re an expert at writing functions and identifying the right language for the right situation

People Analyst – You understand that your work contributes to improving people’s lives not predict when a machine is going to break down

Learner – You are a regular on Stack Overflow, know how to take apart a Vignette and are always looking for a new project that allows you to put that cutting edge technique to good use you read about last month

Documentation Expert – you know just the right level of documentation to help yourself and the next person understand what you did, when and why

Teacher – you’re patient and can field questions from the rest of the team around better coding practices

Experiment Designer – You can create up an A/B test in your sleep, but you don’t let a less than ideal A/B test set up stop you from finding some answers

NLP fanatic – you can turn language into math??? Yeah – that’s the stuff you love!

A few last things about how we work, because they’re super important:
We chat to each other in Slack
We email each other about things that can wait or are just FYI
We store all our code on Stash, how-to’s on Confluence and complete analyses on the Knowledge Repo
We document our code like we’re going to win the lottery tomorrow and somebody else has to take over
We plan and track our work in JIRA so we can avoid duplication with other teams
We collaborate with Data Science at HQ to share best practices and exchange findings

If you’re interested in this role, you’ll need these skills or experiences:
3 to 5 years’ experience in Data Science with focus on NLP
Master’s in Computer Science, Statistics, Operations Research or related field (we will consider a Bachelor’s degree with significant relevant experience)
Expert in at least one Statistical Programming Language such as R or Python
Experience with relational and distributed databases
Experience with any of the following is a big plus: PySpark, Scala, Zepplin Notebooks, Spark and MLlib as well as application development using AWS, Virtual Machines, or Docker
Gaming industry and customer support experience a plus
What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

About HCA

Nashville-based HCA is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 171 locally managed hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44 percent.

Previous project experience with Machine Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Strong Python programing skills; comfortable using Jupyter Notebook to conduct data analysis and visualization
Good communication skills & good independent research skills


How to Apply:

This is a 2-part application process and only those that complete both parts of the application will be considered for the internship. The deadline to apply is Sunday, October 14, 2018.

Application Process:

Go to the career website (https://www.grahamcapital.com/careers.aspx) and apply to the internship: Data Scientist Intern. Please note that you will not be able to upload the Jupyter Notebook file on this site.
Email your Resume/CV and code for the coding test. It will include a .py Python file and a .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file to: pjinternship@grahamcapital.com


Coding Test:

Please go to https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset to download the news category dataset. You will need a Kaggle account to download. You should download the zip file first and extract the JSON file called 'News_Category_Dataset.json'

Use the dataset, write a Python script that does the following:
a. In the comment session, please write down your estimated time for this implementation and your actual start and finish time

b. Write a function that does the following:

i. Aggregate text data under “short_description” and “headline”; Use the aggregated text data to create two N-gram models for N = {1, 2}; write the two models to one EXCEL file in two different sheets

ii. Note: for n-gram models, consider it as a mapping of ‘word -> frequency’. A typical entry in 1-gram would be something like: ‘DATA -> 295’ means word ‘DATA’ appeared 295 times in the text. When writing to EXCEL, you can put word to one column and frequency to another column

c. Your code should run seamlessly in a Python 3 environment. You are welcome to use any Python packages

d. You should assume this function will run periodically so try to make your code clean, robust and scalable

 2. Use the dataset (and maybe N-gram models you created) to do some analysis in Jupyter Notebook:

a. This is an open-ended task

b. Some potential analysis:

i. Some visualization on the dataset; from basics like histograms, to fancy ones like tag cloud, etc.

ii. Some NLP analysis such as tf-idf and LDA, etc.

c. Please keep the notebook clean and include some guidelines so that we can understand your work

Important Notes:

Please understand that these instructions are meant to be high-level guidelines – you have your discretion of the actual implementation
In the first task of implementing a Python function, we value both performance (robustness of your code) and efficiency (how much time you spent on it)

"Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

Maps provide the backbone of Uber’s service, from the driver and rider experience and display to the route recommendations and travel time predictions from one point to another. These routes and predictions feed into all of Uber’s decision systems, like dispatch, UberPool matching, and pricing. Our turn-by-turn navigation service allows drivers to effectively navigate while on or off trip, while our geosearch engine allows users to search for a destination or pickup point. To power these services, Uber Maps also generates base map data (the road map definition and features) and point of interest data (such as restaurants or hotels). ''

A sister team, Sensing and Perception, provides location estimates for Uber’s users while they are engaging with the app; these location estimates also power the user experience and decision systems. Sensing and Perception also does sensor inference modeling to support a wide variety of products, such as accident or fraud detection. Our teams play a critical role in providing a smooth and comfortable rider and driver experience on Uber’s platform, from the moment they open the app until the moment they arrive at their destinations.

"At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.
About the Role

Maps provide the backbone of Uber’s service, from the driver and rider experience and display to the route recommendations and travel time predictions from one point to another. These routes and predictions feed into all of Uber’s decision systems, like dispatch, UberPool matching, and pricing. Our turn-by-turn navigation service allows drivers to effectively navigate while on or off trip, while our geosearch engine allows users to search for a destination or pickup point. To power these services, Uber Maps also generates base map data (the road map definition and features) and point of interest data (such as restaurants or hotels). A sister team, Sensing Inference and Research (SIR), provides location estimates for Uber’s users while they are engaging with the app; these location estimates also power the user experience and decision systems. SIR also does sensor inference modeling to support a wide variety of products, such as accident or fraud detection. Maps plays a critical role in providing a smooth and comfortable rider and driver experience on Uber’s platform, from the moment they open the app till the moment they arrive at the destinations.

We’re looking for data scientists (all levels welcome!) to contribute to all aspects of Uber Maps. We seek candidates with strong background in statistical modeling, experimentation design, machine learning, and operations research. You will be embedded in a product team and work closely with the engineers and product managers in that team. You’ll be focused on developing and analyzing experiments, proposing product metrics and frameworks to link metrics to business impact, and driving the direction of our product development via data-driven insights and algorithmic modeling. You will also be building systems for analysis and monitoring of core performance metrics.
What You'll Do
Develop metrics and experiment design that facilitate product improvements.
Provide data analysis to improve business processes and decisions.
Work alongside engineering teams, product managers and operations to drive the direction of product improvements via mathematical and statistical modeling.
Develop creative solutions to product problems using advanced mathematical algorithms such as machine learning and optimization.
Build and validate prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to decision systems and operational processes.
Work independently, as well as in collaboration with other data scientists.
Communicate with senior management and cross-functional teams.

Sample projects in the team
Define metrics for travel time prediction accuracy and route quality, and link them to business impacts
Design turn costs and objective functions for route recommendation, and link them to impacts on downstream services such as pricing and dispatching
Develop novel machine learning algorithms to mine user generated content and improve places data accuracy
Work with downstream consumers of Maps to launch experiments, measure marketplace impacts, and interpret results
Develop machine learning algorithms to infer and refine driver and rider locations when GPS signals are weak or inaccurate.

What You'll Need
M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Statistics, Machine Learning, Operations Research, or other quantitative disciplines. Alternatively, a BS with 5 or more years of experience in relevant fields.
Knowledge of underlying mathematical foundations of statistics, machine learning and optimization.

"Overview
Who We Are
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.

We’re probably a little more Valley than Beltway. Culture first. Service oriented, non-hierarchical, focused on the work, and less about process/ dress codes/ etc. We believe in giving back, too. For example, our founder leads a company trip every year to the Dominican Republic to build homes as part of Homes of Hope.
Responsibilities
Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Who You Are
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.

"ByteCubed is hiring a Data Scientist/Developer/Engineer to join our Data Science team. Read on to learn more about us, our take on Data Science, the gig, and how to apply!

About ByteCubed

Not so long ago, ByteCubed was a small DC startup founded on the premise that the contracting space was fundamentally broken - as many of us in the DC area know, contracts can be bloated, expensive, and inflexible things, often claiming to provide innovative cure-alls while in fact relying on dated technology stacks. As developers supporting those contracts, we worked in the dark, many degrees of remove from the feedback we needed, and our clients often waited years to see any of the fruits of our labor.

Bytecubed is designed to be different - and while we’re a slightly bigger and more established company now, with a team of about 140 and more than a few awards under our belt, we remain true to the principle that contracts can be lean, agile, focused, innovative, AND profitable enough to keep the lights on and the kids fed.

About this job

People use the words “data science” to mean a lot of different things. At Bytecubed, the data science team mostly does data wrangling, natural language processing, and machine learning. We work with a lot of different kinds of data: unstructured text from the wild web, relational datasets from commercial providers, semi-structured data from public APIs. On a practical level, whether we’re working with social media data or corporate entity data, we’re generally looking for ways to make it easier for client-side folks to do what they already do - look up data, draw connections, anticipate shifts and changes, make hard business decisions - but make it faster, easier, smarter, and more scalable. We leverage libraries from Python and R, tools like Spark and Hadoop, and a range of different SQL and noSQL databases to do that, though we’re fairly open-minded in terms of stack (well, we do have a strong preference for open source).

Who we’re looking for

First off, you’re a U.S. Citizen and able to work in the U.S. (sorry - this one is non-negotiable because of the contracts we work on). It would be great if you are in the DC/MD/VA commuting area, but we can make a remote thing work if necessary.
You have a lot of experience working with data, and you’re comfortable with structured and unstructured data (HTML, XML, JSON, CSV).
You don’t have a dog in the SQL/noSQL fight - you believe in picking the best tool for the job, and you’ve used enough of both to have good instincts about what will work best to solve the problem at hand.
You’ve been doing object-oriented programming for a while (4+ years), and you know Python/R well enough to hit the ground running on Day One.
You have a grasp of machine learning and you’re game to help us find smart ways to implement/integrate data science features (e.g. machine learning models) within a Java- and Angular-based software application.
You have experience with agile software development, know about sprints, scrum, and all that stuff, and you aren’t squeamish about code reviews or rubber ducking.
You understand why version control is important to data science and are willing to using git branching conventions in a routine, methodical, communicative, and participatory way.


Things that are not important to us, But nice to have

 A PhD or some other advanced degree. If you have one, that’s cool (some of us do, too).
 Other fancy credentials, certificates, badges, HackerRank or Kaggle scores, etc.
 Your ability to implement a binary search tree or fizzbuzz on a whiteboard while an interviewer stands behind you.
 Being “full stack” - yes, experience with a range of tools is nice, but we’re more interested in depth than breadth.
 A GitHub profile commit calendar that’s lit up like a Christmas tree. We would like to hear about the projects you’ve worked on in the past, but we understand if they aren’t open source. (Also, if you come work with us, you will have an opportunity to work on open source projects.)
 Working at the office 5 days a week, within an arbitrarily fixed time range every day.
 Your current or past job titles.


How to apply and what to expect

Please send an email with a paragraph or two about yourself and why you’re interested in this job, along with a link to a publicly-viewable LinkedIn profile or resume. Please use thoughtful, conversational English and proof-read your message. Additionally, please briefly describe one or two projects or products you’ve worked on recently for work, fun, or any other reason. Include the capacity you worked on the project and challenges you faced. (Links to code or live versions are great, but we understand if that’s not possible.)
If we choose to move forward we’ll invite you to a 30-60 minute phone screen so you can learn more about ByteCubed and this role and we can learn more about you. About half of this call will be dedicated to your questions for us, so you can begin to evaluate if this job might be a good fit for you and if you want to invest more time in this process.
If that goes well, we’ll give you an at-home coding exercise that involves reading and refactoring some code.
A half-day of in-person interviews. These will build on the code base from the last step. We’ll do a collaborative code review, brainstorm next steps, and do some pair programming together. You will also have an opportunity to meet a range of folks from our company, and will have ample time to ask us all questions.
After each stage we’ll let you know whether or not we’d like to continue as quickly as possible. If you’re advancing to the next stage, we may also give you feedback about what we thought you did well and what you could improve on for the next round.

How do you quantify the cognitive bias that has shaped past pricing decisions to support ongoing sales effort optimization?


There is an exciting journey ahead, and we're going to have fun along the way.

We're kind of nerdy… We geek out about new technology. We love music. We're into soccer. We dance through life (sometimes literally). We're foodies. Essentially…we love noodling on new ideas and our love of learning extends beyond our fields of study. And we like to share that.

About you:
Your experience:

8+ years of experience applying advanced AI techniques (machine learning, predictive analytics, optimization, semantic analysis, time-series analysis, advanced visualization) to real-world problems.

You have an advanced degree in a relevant field (Computer Science, Operations Research, Statistics, Applied Math, Electrical Engineering, or other Computational Science)
You have experience manipulating and preparing large, heterogeneous data sets (""Big Data"") to support advanced analytics.

Your working style:

Collaborative, open, and respectful working style
Intellectual curiosity and the hunger and humility to always keep learning… and to share that learning. You enjoy mentoring other intellectually curious data scientists.
Experience with (and excitement for) interdisciplinary collaboration
Demonstrated energy and passion that extends beyond your field of study – Are you a computer scientist who writes poetry? A mathematician who loves psychology? An engineer passionate about public policy? We want to build something with you.
