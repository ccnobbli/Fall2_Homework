Business Analyst Job Responsibilities
If you read our business analyst job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading!

The core function of our role as business analysts at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats.

So what do all of these “hats” really mean?
Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively.
Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally.
Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.
So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.
Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!"

Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.
So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.
Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!"

Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting.

Although based out of our New York office, our BAs will be on client site up to 4 days a week and therefore need to be flexible to travel.


Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise data from a variety of sources. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.


BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.


Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated.

JOB SUMMARY: Analyzes complex business problems in the areas of identifying, evaluating and developing processes, procedures, policies, training, functional testing, data quality and workflows that are cost effective and meet business requirements. Works on problems of diverse scope where analysis of data requires evaluation of identifiable factors. Demonstrates good judgment in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions.
Expected to develop business requirements with expertise provided from business system analysts including understanding and analyzing the competitive situation; understanding business practices and approaches; recommending business process changes; understanding how to integrate systems and business possesses; driving their work into systems initiatives; understanding business organization, politics and culture; managing change in the business; developing business processes, procedures, and training; exercising any required project management.
There are two major roles required to complete business requirements. One is the person from the business-side called a Business Analyst (BA) and the other is the Business Systems Analyst (BSA). In the design of the BA and BSA roles, there is overlap in the areas of understanding the business and eventually how the automation supports the business. The BA focuses in-depth on the business functionality. The BSA focuses on being the expert partner on how to take that business knowledge into automation and systems. The BSA is responsible for bringing the best practices on how to define and implement business functions, process, workflow, and organizational change management. The BA is responsible for making sure the business needs are met using the expertise brought to the table.
A Business Analyst is fully knowledgeable on the business’s processes, workflow, controls, and functions. Depending upon the person and the situation, this person may just be a resource for helping define the business processes or responsible for additional roles related to the business processes and the projects that are pursued.

They can be held accountable for the training, quality and accuracy of the processes. They may serve as the business owner for these processes but this is rare.
When it comes to projects, they may be assigned roles related to the project and the business’s responsibilities on the project. Sometimes they may be assigned the role of business-side project manager on a project. If they are a business project manager, they may be teamed up with a project manager from the IT side.
In a project, they will be the primary person for approving the business requirements, completing the policies and procedures, addressing business side data conversion and quality, and conducting and approving user acceptance testing.

Program: The mission of the National Name Check Program (NNCP) is to analyze and report information in response to name check requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national security. Many federal agencies seek background information from FBI files before bestowing a privilege—whether that privilege is government employment or an appointment, a security clearance, attendance at a White House function, immigration benefits, naturalization, or a visa to visit the United States. More than 50 agencies regularly request FBI name checks. In addition to serving federal government customers, the NNCP conducts numerous name searches in direct support of the counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and homeland security efforts of the FBI. The employees of the NNCP review and analyze potential identifiable documents to determine if information exists regarding a specific individual, and if so, what information may be disseminated to the requesting agency. It is important to note that the FBI does not adjudicate the final outcome; it just reports the results to the requesting agency. The NNCP conducts manual and electronic searches of the FBI’s Central Records System (CRS). The CRS encompasses the centralized records of FBI Headquarters, field offices, and legal attaché offices, as well as all investigative, administrative, personnel, and general files.
