our goal at capital one is to change banking for good we’re all humans with unique emotions about our money and messaging hugely influences how we feel about the institutions we’ve entrusted to handle that money
the content practices aim is to bring simplicity ingenuity and humanity — and personality where appropriate — to our customers’ experience with their money it’s a big responsibility but that means it’s also a big opportunity to do something real good and important for millions of real people
the design organization’s goal — of which content strategy is an integral part — is to design for impact that’s leading the charge toward a new way of working at capital one we emphasize a design mindset rapid iteration and lean development no matter what we’re working on

founded by adam pisoni the cofounder and former cto of yammer abl  httpsablschoolscom  is an earlystage edtech company developing a data insights platform for k12 principals

in summer 2017 we launched our first product a nextgeneration master scheduler that allows school leaders to build studentcentric schedules master schedules are the pulse of school operations current scheduling tools are not designed to help school leaders meet the needs and personal interests of every student

the role

we are looking for an experienced data scientist and in this role you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff you will collaborate with a team of product designers engineers and school leaders to build features that address complex school logistical challenges

as a data scientist at abl your work will have immediate impact on equity in and operations of schools across the country you will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype with engineers to deploy software into production use and with our schools team to provide decision support for k12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems

recent data science projects include

defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule

as a data team our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done for the current stage of our business our domain and our customers we have found that a bias towards reproducible and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm

responsibilities


build underlying systems that power our datadriven products eg recommendation engines constraint solvers predictive models

identify incomplete data improve the quality of data and integrate data from several data sources
work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts who all store things differently so that we can measure our impact in aggregate
determine how to evaluate equity or fairness for students and for teachers in a schedule
propose metrics for evaluating overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules on the ability to meet school leader priorities
find trends and insights in complex humangenerated school data

qualifications
