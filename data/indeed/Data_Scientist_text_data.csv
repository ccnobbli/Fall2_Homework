Principal Data Scientists within RSS helps drive forward R&D activity by providing a deep level of insight into experimental data, its interpretation and implications for project development efforts. Principal data scientists combine a number of skills from different domains to organize, process, and learn from data, often through the lens of domain-expert informed models that help to abstract concepts from the data, test their validity and make predictions.

The principal data scientist must then synthesize insights from this data and communicate it to internal customers in a way that is both approachable and informative. Given a need for routine analysis by internal customers following a pilot study by the data scientist, the principal data scientist then integrates the necessary analytical or inferential routines into a pipeline through a collaborate software engineering effort, resulting in a validated internal software product that may be used regularly by experimentalist to track their research effort's progress. The principal data scientist may also have scientific expertise in the field of study, often to great advantage for the purpose of this role, though not necessarily at the level of the experimental scientist / customer. Alternatively, the principle data scientist may have little or no scientific expertise in that particular domain but bring an extremely advanced set of skills in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, statistical modeling, signal processing, data engineering, software engineering etc., such that they are generally advantageous members of a project or subproject team regardless of the scientific domain of the problem.

Finally, in some cases, a principal data scientist may be even more specialized with regards to the research, development, or correct implementation of the most advanced versions of the skills and technical approaches in the areas formerly listed, that his/her role requires little or no interaction with experimental groups and is instead focused entirely on advancing the core competencies, tools sets, infrastructures, and processes within the data science organization(s) of RSS.

Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world's largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

We are looking for an intellectually curious person, who has the drive to create sophisticated algorithms that can be translated efficiently to a scalable framework. We value self-driven can-do people that are sticklers for writing quality code over writing code quickly to get the job done. The ideal candidate will have a deep interest in data science, good communication skills, and generally have a positive vibe.

At Capital One, we’re building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.

Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.

Content Designer, Card Design

You love finding ways to describe real human needs in plain language. You LOVE creating solutions that actually help people. And, you guide others on your team to be brave enough to design with humanity. You’re a natural storyteller, information architect, and content designer. You’re also a genuinely nice person with humility and integrity.

A typical day in the life of a Content Strategist at Capital One:
Run a two-hour workshop with a product team, helping them find the human language around the feature they’re building.
Brainstorm with a Content Strategy teammate on how to walk a customer through a sign-in process, or how to make error messages more human.
Work with a design partner to co-write a content workbook, including conversation structure, ideal phrases, human language, and navigation ideas.
Lead a co-writing session with designers, attorneys, and product managers
Answer email. (We’re all trying to spend less time on this, but let’s be real.)
Join a Content Strategy community of practice meeting to share wins, questions, business updates, and team goals across lines of business
Lead a journey-mapping session to outline the customer experience for opening a new account.
Co-write a user-testing script for redesigning an app sign-in flow.
Create content prototypes that will be used to validate hypotheses in testing.
Facilitate a group conversation to help a team clarify what they are working on, or how they are working.
Grab coffee with a product manager to hear what they’re super excited about and how you can help.
Join a Capital One Design all-hands to see what other teams are doing.
Help, support, and coach team members on content design best practices.
Your days look like that because:
Our goal at Capital One is to change banking for good. We’re all humans with unique emotions about our money, and messaging HUGELY influences how we feel about the institutions we’ve entrusted to handle that money.
The Content Practice's aim is to bring simplicity, ingenuity, and humanity — and personality, where appropriate — to our customers’ experience with their money. It’s a big responsibility, but that means it’s also a big opportunity to do something real, good, and important for millions of real people.
The Design organization’s goal — of which content strategy is an integral part — is to Design for Impact. That’s leading the charge toward a new way of working at Capital One. We emphasize a design mindset, rapid iteration, and lean development, no matter what we’re working on.
You’ll need to be pretty dang good at wearing these hats:
Customer Advocate — You’ll dig into who our customers are and what language they use, then ensure our products speak their language
Writer — You’ll build trustworthy relationships with customers by making “simplicity and humanity” core facets of our product content
Editor — You’ll cut or change what doesn’t help audiences find, understand, and choose us
UX Designer — You’ll establish a cohesive conversation with users, both within and across our many digital experiences
Researcher — You’ll test your content on real customers, iterate until it’s clear as a bell, then see it rolled out to millions of people
Data Scientist — You’ll study analytics and use data to drive your messaging decisions and support/dispel your assumptions
You’ll love your job THE MOST if you:
Want to be a part of changing banking for good
See words as an incredibly powerful tool for connecting with people
Are passionate about the customer and want to use your influence to design experiences that build trust and help people
Commit only to what is essential, and your calendar and to-do lists reflect that
Are articulate and prepared, able to confidently substantiate your decisions to peers and senior-level executives alike
Have a positive yet practical attitude; we could call your colleagues and they’d gush over how much they love working with you
Work quickly without compromising quality, knowing that iteration and testing are part-and-parcel to designing exceptional user experiences
Take initiative, aren’t afraid to fail, ask thoughtful questions, and constantly seek better ways of working and communicating
Experiment with methods to develop new ways of getting things done
You’ve probably done these things in your career so far:
Led projects at all phases from discovery through execution
Pulled a conversational thread with customers across channels and teams, balancing business needs with experience principles
Influenced diverse groups—including designers, product managers, and business analysts—and standing as a strong advocate for the customer at every stage of the journey
Owned a body of work, cutting through ambiguity and producing content artifacts that add clarity and momentum to design requests and projects
Advocated successfully for new (and likely contrarian) ideas to senior executives and cross-functional partners
Build productive relationships with product and business partners with potentially conflicting priorities, road maps, or dialects
Inspired other content practitioners through your experience with techniques, tools, and a mature process
You might feel pretty bummed about this job if you:
Want to focus on content marketing
Prefer owning a project individually to coaching others collaboratively through a project
Work better in structured environments than in ambiguity and uncertainty
Care more about your deliverables than the problem the team is solving
A few last things because they’re super important:
As part of the UX Content Strategy practice, you’ll sit at the intersection of content and product design. Some projects on the team need traditional content development and management (building web experiences, creating emails, etc.). Other roles are more solidly in product and experience design (for example, what happens when a customer doesn’t pay a bill?).
You’ll be a champion of content-first design in every project and product you work on. Ideally, you’ll help a team nail the right conversation from the beginning, then build an experience around that. Other times you’ll meet a team right where they are, helping them find the right language for what they have now, while thinking about how to make it better next time.
You’ll do a lot of getting-it-done without worrying about who’s “supposed” to do it. You’ll run a workshop, then clean up the conference room. You’ll jump in and moderate customer interviews at the last minute because your team needs you.
You’ll be the glue connecting teams who’ve never worked together before.
Basic Qualifications:
At least 5 years of full-time experience with digital content design
Preferred Qualifications:
Master’s Degree in Communications, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), or Design

Create the model that transforms an industry
********************************************

Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.

States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

*************************************************
We're growing our data science team at all levels
*************************************************

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at The White House, Google, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

**************************
Do you have what it takes?

Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)
Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)
Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)
Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)

299,"Company Overview

Founded by Adam Pisoni, the co-founder and former CTO of Yammer, Abl ( https://ablschools.com/ ) is an early-stage edtech company developing a data insights platform for K12 principals.

In summer 2017, we launched our first product, a next-generation Master Scheduler that allows school leaders to build student-centric schedules. Master schedules are the pulse of school operations. Current scheduling tools are not designed to help school leaders meet the needs and personal interests of every student.

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You will collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers and school leaders to build features that address complex school logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl your work will have immediate impact on equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with Product Designers to determine what to build and prototype, with Engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our Schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent Data Science Projects Include:

Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule - the Abl Opportunity Matrix
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking

The Team

Abl product research and development is a small, passionate, and inclusive team. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a Data Team our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities


Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, predictive models)
Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl's product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production
Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling
Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools
Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources
Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate
Determine how to evaluate equity or fairness, for students and for teachers, in a schedule
Propose metrics for evaluating overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules on the ability to meet school leader priorities
Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications


Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)
Proficiency in writing SQL queries
Clear communicator with the ability, and desire, to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences in writing, through reporting tools, and in-person presentations
Experience with cleaning, structuring and transforming data via ETL processes
Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

Company Culture

Abl employees all share a passion for revolutionizing education through school design, whether or not they have prior experience working in the field. We value the diversity of background and thought. We strive to create a safe and supportive environment where trust, communication, creativity, and humility are valued as highly as technical skills. We believe shared ownership builds a more resilient company, and we tackle hard problems, together.

About the Company

Our CEO, Kyle Sherman, worked as a cannabis compliance officer and experienced the problems with cannabis business software first hand. Frustrated by the platform his vertically integrated supply chain was using, he searched for something better. When his search failed him, he became fueled by a passion to create a system that would accelerate workflows, increase accuracy, and simplify compliance — ultimately allowing legalization to expand nationally.

In early 2015 Kyle began to build a team who shared his passion for cannabis, technology, and problem solving and started lobbying for a metrc™ open API. Headquartered in Downtown Denver, we've positioned ourselves on the front lines alongside large scale growers and dispensary owners in order to design the best possible product for the industry.

418,"Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

We place particular emphasis on providing a robust system of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
Specifically, we are looking for:

A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.
Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming

What it’s like to work here:

On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.
We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.
We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.
We’re building a company and a team we love. We’re in it for the long run.

Develop a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.
Create, maintain, and document a robust set of metrics to monitor day-to-day bug detection and long-term performance tracking.
Tell stories that describe analytical results and insights in meetings of all sizes with diverse audiences.
Consult with business partners and provide analytics oriented thought leadership across a variety of non-technical audiences to ensure that all levels of Zillow Group make data driven decisions.
Who you are
You will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty. You will develop a deep understanding of our mission, business models, and personas. We want you to use that intuition you've developed (both in business and real life) to find opportunities for growth and cultivate insights from our massive data sets. We're looking for a seasoned data scientist who has:
An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, quantitative finance, operations research, statistics, or similar) or demonstrable experience within data science and analytics.
2+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving
Foundational analytical skills (demonstrated understanding of SQL, command of Excel, and experience using Tableau and R/Python)
A proficient understanding of real estate investment metrics
1-2 years experience in a highly analytical role in a financial services or technology setting with experience in financial modeling
Strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills to concisely communicate in a way that provides context, offers insights, and minimizes misinterpretation.
The skills to work cross-functionally and push business partners to focus on realistic goals and projects.

i. Aggregate text data under “short_description” and “headline”; Use the aggregated text data to create two N-gram models for N = {1, 2}; write the two models to one EXCEL file in two different sheets

ii. Note: for n-gram models, consider it as a mapping of ‘word -> frequency’. A typical entry in 1-gram would be something like: ‘DATA -> 295’ means word ‘DATA’ appeared 295 times in the text. When writing to EXCEL, you can put word to one column and frequency to another column

c. Your code should run seamlessly in a Python 3 environment. You are welcome to use any Python packages

d. You should assume this function will run periodically so try to make your code clean, robust and scalable

 2. Use the dataset (and maybe N-gram models you created) to do some analysis in Jupyter Notebook:

a. This is an open-ended task

b. Some potential analysis:

i. Some visualization on the dataset; from basics like histograms, to fancy ones like tag cloud, etc.

ii. Some NLP analysis such as tf-idf and LDA, etc.

c. Please keep the notebook clean and include some guidelines so that we can understand your work

Important Notes:

Please understand that these instructions are meant to be high-level guidelines – you have your discretion of the actual implementation
In the first task of implementing a Python function, we value both performance (robustness of your code) and efficiency (how much time you spent on it)

At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
If you are someone motivated by meaningful work, Shift Technology may just be the spot for you!

Your day-to-day

At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too.
Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems.
The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis …
As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available.
Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve.
After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to:

Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms;
Create the associated mathematical models;
Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms;
Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models;
Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution.
Your toolkit

On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast!


Your profile

Shift Technology’s data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities.
If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology:

You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research;
You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details;

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

Our Team

We’re a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded, team of self-starters who show up every day for the same reason: to create an impact on the way the world innovates. Our aim this year at Brightidea is to make it our Best Year Ever and we plan to accomplish that through our creative, focused, ambitious, and humble approach to change the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone entering our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you can identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful than this could be the perfect team for you to add your contributions to and shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas.

Our data scientists have a healthy mix of training, special projects, self-directed research, and of course client work. Much of our client work is defense related and requires a security clearance, though not everyone we hire will need one. The texture of training/projects/research/client work depends largely on the individual, in keeping with our philosophy of finding talented colleagues instead of starting with a list of line-item qualifications and looking for someone who fits them snugly on paper.

Qualifications

Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not know them all, but you are comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You likely have a degree in math/stats/computer science, but we also know that great data scientists sometimes come from outside those typical disciplines. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. You have an entrepreneurial spirit driven by curiosity.

Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
Data Scientist, EA Customer Experience
#WeAreEA and we exist to inspire the world to play. EA values creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork. We mean things like acting with curiosity, speaking up with original ideas, and committing to each other as one team.

We’re looking for all the best kinds of people to make great experiences for our players. The best people want a job that inspires them, while giving them room to enjoy their lives. And we want to give them that. We celebrate diversity and inclusion by creating a place where you can come to work and be yourself.

You’re a Data Scientist.

You know how to pull all types of data from any source, be it Facebook posts, call center chats, video likes or survey results. You understand that you have 2 basic jobs:

Help our studios understand what problems players have with their games and provide insights that help optimize our call center. Both pursue the ultimate goal of providing the World’s Best Service for the World’s Best Games.

You use all resources available to you to help solve a problem, be it a new algorithm, programming language or the person sitting next to you.

You’re a programmer/statistician/NLP expert who is fanatic about games and Customer Experiences.

You’re also a genuinely nice person who brings positive energy to an office. You’re approachable and take the time to listen so that you understand someone else’s view.

This role is part of EA’s Customer Experience organization. The Customer Experience organization strives to make EA known for taking care of its players. We’re players taking care of players and people talking to people – whenever, wherever, and however they need us.

We’re the Data Science team, part of the larger Customer Experience Insights team.
We are surrounded by Production, BI, SEO and Market Research analysts. We’re the people who use advanced statistics and modeling to help solve business problems. We surface player problems through our text analytics offerings. We write a lot of code and talk to stakeholders from all teams and all levels. We are great team mates and trusted advisors, who provide insights to facilitate decisions and create models that change experiences.

A typical day in the life of a Data Scientist:
Come into the office and catch up with your team mates about last night’s gaming session or the hottest show on TV (no spoilers until 24hrs have passed – after that: anything is fair game!)
Check on last night’s Jenkins script and add some code to a project you’re working on
Talk to one of your coworkers on the Call Center side about how to match the right advisor to the right player – this could be your next big project
Take some time back at your desk to write up any notes and make a project plan proposal
Attend a JIRA prioritization meeting to update work that’s in flight and plan for work to come
Grab coffee and read up on any stats blogs or tech news you’re subscribed to
Check out the model you deployed into production last month to see if it’s time to re-train
Pull the latest changes on an NLP model you’re collaborating on from Stash and tinker with the parameters, then chat with your peer about the results of the tweaks and make plans for what to change next
Spend a couple of hours heads down/headphones on getting series with an analysis.
Finish the day looking over any code you wrote today, knit any Markdowns and make sure your documentation is up to snuff.
So how do Data Scientists make great experiences for players? They:

Tell stories with data and interpret results for their stakeholders
Prioritize problems to solve based on the impact to the player experience while keeping overall organizational goals in mind
Have a basic understanding of EA’s games and find time to play whenever they can
Display confidence in communicating with senior management, or any audience, to ensure what they say is heard and understood
Identify and lead collaborative efforts both inside and outside of their team; working with key influencers to effect change
Tailor communications to their audience, providing either in-depth expertise or a high-level summary depending on the situation
Use models and techniques that win on performance and understandability vs. sophistication
You’ll need to be awesome at wearing these hats:

Customer Advocate – You care what kind of experience our players are having when their games or services don’t work and you want to be an active participant in improving it

Programmer – You’re an expert at writing functions and identifying the right language for the right situation

People Analyst – You understand that your work contributes to improving people’s lives not predict when a machine is going to break down

Learner – You are a regular on Stack Overflow, know how to take apart a Vignette and are always looking for a new project that allows you to put that cutting edge technique to good use you read about last month

Documentation Expert – you know just the right level of documentation to help yourself and the next person understand what you did, when and why

Teacher – you’re patient and can field questions from the rest of the team around better coding practices

Experiment Designer – You can create up an A/B test in your sleep, but you don’t let a less than ideal A/B test set up stop you from finding some answers

NLP fanatic – you can turn language into math??? Yeah – that’s the stuff you love!

A few last things about how we work, because they’re super important:
We chat to each other in Slack
We email each other about things that can wait or are just FYI
We store all our code on Stash, how-to’s on Confluence and complete analyses on the Knowledge Repo
We document our code like we’re going to win the lottery tomorrow and somebody else has to take over
We plan and track our work in JIRA so we can avoid duplication with other teams
We collaborate with Data Science at HQ to share best practices and exchange findings

If you’re interested in this role, you’ll need these skills or experiences:
3 to 5 years’ experience in Data Science with focus on NLP
Master’s in Computer Science, Statistics, Operations Research or related field (we will consider a Bachelor’s degree with significant relevant experience)
Expert in at least one Statistical Programming Language such as R or Python
Experience with relational and distributed databases
Experience with any of the following is a big plus: PySpark, Scala, Zepplin Notebooks, Spark and MLlib as well as application development using AWS, Virtual Machines, or Docker
Gaming industry and customer support experience a plus
What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!
We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks!
