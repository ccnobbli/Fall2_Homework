201,"Position Description:
The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) functions as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary translational research programmatic effort with the goal of developing novel immunotherapies for cancer. The LTIB strategic plan focuses on the development of novel immunotherapeutics for human cancer, not only as monotherapies, but more importantly, in combination with other immune-mediating modalities, and other conventional or experimental therapies, as part of an immuno-oncology programmatic effort. Within this effort are several research groups, a clinical trials group, and multiple collaborations with intramural and extramural scientific and clinical investigators and with investigators in the private sector.

The program takes advantage of the uniqueness of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) intramural program in that it spans high-risk basic discovery research in immunology genomics and tumor biology, through preclinical translational research, to paradigm-shifting clinical trials. Focus is placed on the design and development of novel “off-the-shelf” recombinant (rec.) immunotherapeutics that can be used in clinical studies at numerous institutions. A major strength of the program is the rapid translation of preclinical studies to hypothesis-generating clinical trials.

The Center for Cancer Research (CCR) is the intramural research component of the NCI. CCR’s enabling infrastructure facilitates clinical studies at the NIH Clinical Center, provides extensive opportunities for collaboration, and allows scientists and clinicians to undertake high-risk, high-impact laboratory- and clinic-based investigations. Investigators are supported by a wide array of intellectual, technological, and research resources, including animal facilities and dedicated, high-quality technology cores in areas such as imaging/microscopy, chemistry/purification, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, genomics/DNA sequencing, transgenics and knockout mice, arrays/molecular profiling, and human genetics/bioinformatics. For an overview of CCR, please visit https://ccr.cancer.gov/.

Qualifications:
We are looking for a biologist with experience or ability to learn and perform various cell biology and molecular biology techniques, these include cell culture of murine and human cell lines, assays involving DNA & RNA purification, and assays involving flow cytometry.

B.S. or M.S. in Biologic Sciences

Responsibilities
Developing metabolic models and modeling tools to inform the (re)design of microorganisms for the production of cultured ingredients
Leveraging heterogenous datasets generated by the test team of the foundry to refine and validate your computational models
Helping to inform experimental design to maximize the collection of useful data on organism performance

Epigenetics in Metabolism

The Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) is an independent and world-class biomedical research institute dedicated to determining the fundamental molecular origins of disease and translating those findings into effective therapies. VARI is home to more than 300 scientists and staff that work in on-site laboratories and collaborative partnerships that span the globe.

VARI’s research pillars, built upon epigenetics, cancer and neuro-degeneration research, will see the addition of a brand new inter-program initiative focusing on metabolism and metabolic (re)programing, starting at the end of 2018.

The Pospisilik lab, a founding member of this metabolism focus, tries to understand the epigenetic and evolutionary basis of disease heterogeneity, non-Mendelian phenotypic variation, and intergenerational control, and is seeking a full-time Computational Biologist to join the team. The successful candidate’s will build upon our recent epigenomic analyses from both targeted and consortium (International Human Epigenome Consortium [IHEC/DEEP]) efforts which have identified chromatin-based mechanisms for buffering diabetes and beta-cell dedifferentiation (Lu / Heyne, Cell Metab 2018), establishing bi-stability and disease canalization (Dalgaard, Cell 2016), and producing intergenerational disease responses to diet (Oest / Lempradl, Cell 2014). Current projects extend these and previous works dissecting human, mouse and fly phenotypic variation, as well as novel signaling modules that link metabolism, to adipose tissues browning, inflammation and even hypothalamic nutritional state. A primary focus will be to model and dissect what we believe to be the first mammalian developmental ‘switch’ genes that triggers distinct ‘on’ and ‘off’ epigenetic disease states in mouse and man.

The successful candidate will be an independent and motivated team player with strong communication skills and a strong interest in epigenetic control, heterogeneity, patterns, disease physiology, and thinking in abstract computation spaces. They will cherish efficiency and be results oriented.

If successful, you will:

Support data management, script dissemination, and analysis of genomics, epigenomics and metabolomics data
Where necessary develop, maintain, and support computational biology pipelines
Perform data mining at scale on both local and (where feasible) cloud pilot resources
Preprint and publish results and novel methods, serving as primary or contributing author
Anticipate and keep abreast of new developments in bioinformatics
Interact and liaise with consortium efforts and joint analyses
Help mentor graduate students and postdocs with significant bioinformatics in their projects


EXPECTATIONS

The following expectations should be met within the first 3 months.

Within 1 month – Develop a solid understanding of at least one major project, adapt to VARI computing landscape, and demonstrate analytical efficiency and reproducibility

286,"Position Summary
Known for its scientific and operational excellence, Regeneron is a leading science-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Regeneron commercializes medicines for eye diseases, high LDL-cholesterol, atopic dermatitis and a rare inflammatory condition and has product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, pain, cancer and infectious diseases.

Summary
We are seeking a PhD-level scientist to join our growing structural biology group. This position will focus exclusively on cryo-electron microscopy of molecules in Regeneron's drug development pipeline, including membrane proteins, large multi-protein assemblies, and antibody-target complexes. This is a tremendous opportunity for an individual to contribute to projects of real medical impact, as well as help establish cryo-electron microscopy as a tool to drive Regeneron's research forward.

Responsibilities
This work will involve many of the stages of a structural biology project, from protein characterization and complex purification, to EM grid preparation, negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy data collection, data processing, structure determination and refinement. Earlier-stage work such as cloning, protein expression, and protein purification will be carried out by other groups at Regeneron, but our group will remain involved in these stages, e.g. when special constructs are required for the structural work.

Although the goal of our efforts will be to produce high-resolution cryoEM structures, it will be important to generate results for the project at each stage of the process, from initial micrographs, to negative stain 2D and 3D reconstructions, to low-resolution cryoEM maps. Many projects will benefit greatly even if a near-atomic resolution structure is not possible.

At the moment, and for the near future, we are traveling to external imaging facilities and using their microscopes to collect our data. However, we will install our own Titan Krios at Regeneron in late 2019, providing nearly unlimited time for data collection on a state of the art microscope. One of the main responsibilities of this position will be to ensure that this microscope is used productively, by generating enough cryoEM samples to ""feed the beast"", and by processing and analyzing the resulting data. The group is small enough that we will not have a dedicated person to maintain the microscope, so all group members will be responsible for routine maintenance and alignment, with a service contract in place for more significant repairs.

This position will be highly collaborative, interacting with scientists in all areas of Regeneron R&D and beyond. The person hired for this job will need to understand complex research projects involving many different scientific areas, contribute in project meetings to shape the direction of the research, clearly communicate their structural results to an audience of non-structural biologists, and direct the course of their own work without extensive supervision.

#LI-CB1

Requirements
This position requires a minimum of a PhD in structural biology, with the thesis research being mostly or completely focused on protein cryo-electron microscopy. Research on an integrated structural biology project (combining cryoEM with other techniques) is acceptable, as long as cryoEM was at the core of the project and represents the majority of the work performed.

2-4 years of postdoctoral experience in protein cryoEM or closely related fields (e.g. cryo-electron tomography) is also highly desirable.

Experience in other structural biology disciplines such as X-ray crystallography or protein NMR is helpful, but cannot substitute for the cryoEM experience.

Since this position will be hands-on in the lab, a substantial amount of experience purifying and characterizing proteins is also necessary.

The successful candidate must have a demonstrated track record of independent research including one or more first-author publications.

This position will involve work on many different projects simultaneously, so excellent record-keeping and time management skills are very important, as well as the ability to absorb new information rapidly. The candidate must be able to work collaboratively with scientists from different backgrounds, and be able to explain their results clearly and concisely to many different audiences, most of whom will have little or no experience in structural biology.

It will be very helpful if the candidate has some direct experience maintaining and aligning electron microscopes, as we have no facility manager and will need to carry out these tasks ourselves (along with a service contract from the manufacturer).

This is an opportunity to join our select team that is already leading the way in the Pharmaceutical/Biotech industry. Apply today and learn more about Regeneron’s unwavering commitment to combining good science & good business.

To all agencies: Please, no phone calls or emails to any employee of Regeneron about this opening. All resumes submitted by search firms/employment agencies to any employee at Regeneron via-email, the internet or in any form and/or method will be deemed the sole property of Regeneron, unless such search firms/employment agencies were engaged by Regeneron for this position and a valid agreement with Regeneron is in place. In the event a candidate who was submitted outside of the Regeneron agency engagement process is hired, no fee or payment of any kind will be paid.

Regeneron is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.","Tarrytown, NY",Scientist - Cryo Electron Microscopy,False

About Category Rating (DEU) Procedures (Basis for Rating):
Category rating procedures will be used to rate and rank candidates.
The answers you provide to the applicant self-assessment questions will be used, in conjunction with the supporting documents you include, and your resume, to determine your eligibility for Federal employment and your qualification for this position specifically.
Your application score is used to place you into one of three quality categories: ""Best Qualified"", ""Well Qualified"", and ""Qualified"". (The category assignment is a measure of the degree in which your background matches the competencies required for this position.)
The cut-off score for each quality category may vary from announcement to announcement, and is determined by each agency, in advance of the advertisement going live.
Category Rating does not add veterans preference points but protects the rights of veterans by placing them ahead of non-preference eligibles within each category. Preference eligibles Vets who meet the minimum qualification requirements and who have a compensable service-connected disability of at least 30% must be listed in the highest quality category (except in the case of scientific or professional positions at the GS-9 level or higher).
Only applications in the Best Qualified category are referred to the hiring office for consideration.
If a high volume of applications are from highly qualified preference eligible Veterans, FDA's HR office may elect to refer ONLY those preference eligible Veterans to the hiring office for consideration.
If FDA receives a small number of applications, or if the score range of applications in the highest quality category is low enough, the Best Qualified category may be merged with the Well Qualified category and the merged list may be provided to the hiring office instead.
Your qualifications will be evaluated on the following competencies (knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics). You do not need to respond to the KSA's directly, but your resume should contain sufficient information to demonstrate possession of the Competencies ?.

For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.

Written Test- Evidence of having successfully passed the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) examination, or the written test required for professional registration, which is administered by the Boards of Engineering Examiners in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.Applicants who have passed the EIT examination and have completed all the requirements for either (a) a bachelor's degree in engineering technology (BET) from an accredited college of university that included 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences, or (b) a BET from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be rated eligible for certain engineering positions at GS-5. Eligibility is limited to positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of the engineering technology program. Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development, or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science must meet the basic requirements in paragraph A.

Because of the diversity in kind and quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of the possession of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be demonstrated by passing the EIT examination.

Specified academic courses - Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in paragraph A.

About the Employer:
In the mid-1920's, John G. Shedd, a successful Chicago businessman, wanted to give back to the city in which he had risen from a stock boy to president of Marshall Field & Company, a leading department store chain. Because every great city in the United States and Europe had a fine aquarium, he decided that Chicago should have the biggest. The new Shedd combined the best of early 20th-century “age of aquariums” characteristics — a diverse, global animal collection surrounded by eye-popping architecture — with advances in animal care, environments, and interpretation.
A nonprofit organization dedicated to animal care and welfare, conservation research and public education, Shedd is known today as “The World's Aquarium.” Situated on the shore of Lake Michigan, Shedd is home to nearly 32,000 aquatic animals representing more than 1,500 species of fishes, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, birds and mammals from waters around the world.
A vital learning resource, scientific contributor and conservation champion, the Aquarium each year welcomes approximately 2 million guests including a quarter-million students from elementary and secondary schools. Shedd is one of the most-attended aquariums in the United States, and is the top-attended paid cultural institution in Chicago. It continues to be a popular family destination for tourists and a powerful source of economic activity for the city.
Of its annual visitors, approximately 40 percent reside in the greater Chicago area, another 48 percent come from the rest of the U.S., and 12 percent represent international visitors. Shedd runs an annual budget of $55 million, including a payroll of $19 million covering 268 full-time employees and 227 part-time and temporary employees. In 2014, Shedd's economic impact through employment, tourism and local spending exceeded $100 million.
Conservation Science and Research. The biologists and conservation scientists in Shedd's Daniel P. Haerther Center for Conservation and Research perform field work in both the Great Lakes and Caribbean regions. As responsible stewards of the animals in its care, Shedd is committed to conserving species and ecosystems through research that increases knowledge, informs policy, enhances livelihoods and inspires public visitors to become environmental champions.","Chicago, IL",Research Biologist â Urban Freshwater Conservation,False

Research Area: Data Science

Help dramatically expand the applications of machine learning by automating the process of constructing machine learning solutions. It currently takes machine learning experts weeks or months to solve new problems. Automating this process will decrease the time required by these experts to create solutions and may make it possible for biologists, physicians, urban planners, and others without a machine learning background to interact with an automated system and obtain high-quality solutions.


Training such an automated system requires many datasets with machine learning solutions to a wide variety of problems. We are looking for students to help gather unprocessed datasets from the internet that include raw data and a problem of interest. They must curate the data and construct solutions to develop a community-wide resource that can be used to train automated machine learning systems. Each student will be challenged with a wide range of problem types and machine learning applications that require solutions. Students will also develop an automated learning system using the datasets as they are generated. To facilitate large-scale data processing and model learning, students will have access to the computing resources of the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.

This project is an opportunity to be supervised by leaders in the field from MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Human Language Technology and other groups. The candidate should be pursuing an undergraduate degree at MIT and must have demonstrated experience implementing machine-learning systems.
MIT Lincoln Laboratory is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) employer.

430,"InternshipOur mission is to make biology easier to engineer. Ginkgo is constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world in order to answer the globe’s growing challenges in health, energy, food, materials, and more. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house automated foundry for designing and building new organisms. Today, our foundry is developing over 40 different organisms to make different products across multiple industries.

Padawans (what we call interns) at Ginkgo work on projects just as ambitious as the Jedis (what we call full-time employees). Because of this, we’re looking for the best scientists and engineers who are excited by the challenges of scaling and improving our foundry in our Padawans. Because it touches nearly every part of the foundry, the Automation Team is integral to Ginkgo’s vision for the future. We are creating integrated robotic workcells, designing processes around walkup robotic systems, improving how data is handled, working with scientists on scaling their processes, and much more. All the work we do is in service of increasing Ginkgo’s capacity in terms of the number of strains engineered and the diversity of species and products we can handle. It’s an enormous challenge and we need people who are eager to get started. You’ll be working hand-in-hand with biologists, software developers, and other engineers to co-develop the wetware, hardware, and software infrastructure that underpin the foundry.

This is a one year, full-time internship. We've found that three-month summer internships are too short for someone to get up to speed and be productive in our organism engineering foundry. Applicants are taken on a rolling basis. We suggest you apply two months before your intended start date. Undergraduate applicants are typically seniors looking for post-graduation plans and graduate applicants should be planning to graduate within a year. The Padawan position is also a good way for someone with less industry experience to get a chance to see if Ginkgo is a good fit.
Responsibilities
Developing automated experimental workflows for genetic engineering processes, strain cultivation, sample preparation, and multi-omics analysis
Writing software to drive operation of laboratory instruments and robotics
Validating and QC'ing automated protocols
Writing software for data acquisition, retrieval, and processing
Operating automation equipment with biologists
Training automation users on workflows and best practices
Supporting and maintaining automation hardware
Designing and building integrated automation infrastructure, including workcells for executing high-throughput processes, as well as flexible distributed automation tooling
Requirements
Ability to work at Ginkgo Bioworks for up to one year as a Padawan
Experience with laboratory automation systems and experimental workflow development
Software development capability, especially pertaining to hardware control
Practical knowledge of high-throughput biological processes
Experience in hardware development, integration, and testing

Ginkgo Bioworks secures $275 million in Series D, valuing the company at over $1 billion (TechCrunch)
Can This Company Convince You to Love GMOs? (The Atlantic)
Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars Pour Into Hacking Microbes (Forbes)

We also feel it’s important to point out the obvious here – there’s a serious lack of diversity in our industry and it needs to change. Our goal is to help drive that change. We hope to continue to build a company whose culture promotes inclusion and embraces how rewarding it is to work with engineers from all walks of life. Making biology easier to engineer is a tough nut to crack – we can’t afford to leave any talent untapped.

WHAT WE DO

We start with various human cell types in our automated laboratory, where we perturb biology 100k different ways each week (e.g. model a disease of interest, add a chemical compound, or some combination of those). We image the resulting cells using high throughput microscopy, resulting in about 2 million new images or greater than 20 terabytes of data each week. These data are analyzed using computer vision and machine learning methods that help us measure how cell morphology changes in subtle ways in each biological context. We can answer direct questions (e.g. are there compounds that rescues a disease-specific set of morphological changes), and over time as our dataset has increased, we can ask more complex questions across biology. From the outset, our approach is agnostic to preconceived notions and dogma in biology, enabling Recursion to operate in novel target space. Potential treatments from this platform are then evaluated by our discovery biology team, who develop a literature-based understanding of the disease and use traditional wet-lab approaches to confirm and prioritize the hits.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.


We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity

Our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. CZI fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research. Examples of the work CZI Science is supporting include the Human Cell Atlas, a global project to create a complete reference map of all the cells in the human body; and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, an independent nonprofit research hub to bring scientists and engineers together from Stanford, UCSF, UC Berkeley, along with the engineering team from CZI.

Our Technology team in Science is seeking an experienced User Experience Researcher to conduct rigorous research on the Infectious Disease Sequencing (IDseq) tool ( https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-web ), a collaboration between CZI and Dr. Joe DeRisi's lab ( http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/ ).

487,"This position is an opportunity to play a critical role in the development of large resources to improve the understanding of the function and disease impact of human genetic variants. The Broad Institute is accumulating data sets of genetic variation of unprecedented scale, covering a wide range of human ancestries, technologies, and disease areas, and spanning hundreds of thousands of people. This role would involve work on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; gnomad.broadinstitute.org ), the world’s largest reference database of sequenced humans, led by Daniel MacArthur, and on the Broad’s Center for Mendelian Genomics, an NIH-funded collaborative venture focused on discovering new disease genes, and the Rare Genomes Project (https://raregenomes.org/), a direct-to-patient genome sequencing initiative providing diagnoses to rare disease families across the US, both co-led by Heidi Rehm and Daniel MacArthur. Our mission is to create open resources for scientists and clinicians, and to use these resources to improve rare disease diagnosis, discover new disease genes, understand the functional impact of genetic variation, and empower the basic and clinical genomics community worldwide.

We are searching for an enthusiastic variant curator to research and classify genetic variants identified through gnomAD and our rare disease genomics efforts. This will involve using ClinGen’s variant curation tool, as well as other third party tools, and internally-developed software to determine a variant’s pathogenicity. The curator will also have the opportunity to use our in-house software to analyze and interpret genetic variation in families to diagnose patients with rare disease. In addition, he/she will work in close collaboration with other members of our team, which includes analysts, genetic counselors, clinicians, computational biologists, software engineers, and project managers.

The candidate should have a strong background in genetics or a related discipline, have fluency in human disease genetics, have good attention to detail and be able to adapt quickly and be part of a cross-functional team in a rapidly changing environment.

This is an opportunity to work at the interface between large-scale genomics, informatics, and disease genetics, and to have an impact on the lives of thousands of families affected by rare, severe diseases.

Primary Responsibilities:
Perform clinical correlation of gene/variant with patient phenotype, scientific literature review, and variant classification using ACMG criteria.
Directly analyze exome and genome data for identification of disease-causing variants, using existing and newly-developed analysis tools through in-house software (seqr), for hundreds of rare disease families.
Present results and progress at regular team and other Broad Institute meetings.
Manage interactions with several research, industry and clinical collaborators to facilitate information exchange regarding variant classification.
Participate in education and mentorship of other staff and collaborators through direct interaction and presentations.
Involvement in abstract, figure, and manuscript preparation and submission, and presentations at local or national professional conferences.

About the Employer:
In the mid-1920's, John G. Shedd, a successful Chicago businessman, wanted to give back to the city in which he had risen from a stock boy to president of Marshall Field & Company, a leading department store chain. Because every great city in the United States and Europe had a fine aquarium, he decided that Chicago should have the biggest. The new Shedd combined the best of early 20th-century “age of aquariums” characteristics — a diverse, global animal collection surrounded by eye-popping architecture — with advances in animal care, environments, and interpretation.
A nonprofit organization dedicated to animal care and welfare, conservation research and public education, Shedd is known today as “The World's Aquarium.” Situated on the shore of Lake Michigan, Shedd is home to nearly 32,000 aquatic animals representing more than 1,500 species of fishes, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, birds and mammals from waters around the world.
A vital learning resource, scientific contributor and conservation champion, the Aquarium each year welcomes approximately 2 million guests including a quarter-million students from elementary and secondary schools. Shedd is one of the most-attended aquariums in the United States, and is the top-attended paid cultural institution in Chicago. It continues to be a popular family destination for tourists and a powerful source of economic activity for the city.
Of its annual visitors, approximately 40 percent reside in the greater Chicago area, another 48 percent come from the rest of the U.S., and 12 percent represent international visitors. Shedd runs an annual budget of $55 million, including a payroll of $19 million covering 268 full-time employees and 227 part-time and temporary employees. In 2014, Shedd's economic impact through employment, tourism and local spending exceeded $100 million.
Conservation Science and Research. The biologists and conservation scientists in Shedd's Daniel P. Haerther Center for Conservation and Research perform field work in both the Great Lakes and Caribbean regions. As responsible stewards of the animals in its care, Shedd is committed to conserving species and ecosystems through research that increases knowledge, informs policy, enhances livelihoods and inspires public visitors to become environmental champions.","Chicago, IL",Research Biologist â Native Non-Game Species Conservation,False

522,"We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with computational background to join the CGA Cancer Resistance team. We have undertaken an ambitious 5-year project aimed at discovering the basis of drug resistance in cancer. While cancer treatments (including chemo-, targeted- and immuno-therapies) work for months or years, cancers eventually recur. In most cancers and treatments, the causes of drug resistance are not yet understood.

There are a range of questions at the core of resistance: (i) What are the drivers of resistance ( genetic and/or epigenetic)? (ii) What are vulnerabilities of resistant cells? Novel therapies may exploit these vulnerabilities. We look for vulnerabilities using CRISPR, gene knockout, and small molecule screens of resistant and sensitive cell lines. (iii) Are there mutational mechanisms that contribute to development of resistance (e.g. APOBEC or MSI)? (iv) What can we learn from the dynamics of clones under drug selective pressure? Can we use sub-clonal structure and dynamics to identify multiple resistance mechanisms in a single patient? (v) Can we predict resistance mechanisms that will develop based on tumor type, treatment, genomics of tumor and patient i.e. can we find biomarkers of the resistance mechanism? (vi) In which cases can we predict effective therapy combinations based on the initial biopsy?

We plan to characterise the mechanisms of resistance through genetic characterization of patient tumor samples (germline, pre-treatment and post-resistance) and functional genomics using drug and CRISPR screens of cell lines. As a member or this team, you will collaborate with scientists and engineers in a collegial work environment with intellectual rigor. By applying your statistical and machine learning skills to multimodal cancer data, you will drive the generation and testing of hypotheses leading to new biological insights in cancer resistance. This project is a rare opportunity to contribute to one of the most important and challenging problems facing cancer medicine today.
CHARACTERISTIC DUTIES
 Design and execute data analysis strategies to support research projects involving multimodal cancer datasets.
 Together with other team members you will develop new methodologies for integrative analysis of functional and genomic data.
 Explore novel data representation modes with emphasis on integrating diverse data types.
 Analyses typically consist of the application or development of computational tools to a) assess data quality, b) characterize germline and somatic variants, and c) quantify how these variants impact tumor evolution and resistance to therapy.
 Present ideas and results to the multi-disiplinary members of the Cancer Genome Analysis Group. Prepare written reports and
presentations for internal use as well as presentations at conferences.

QUALIFICATIONS
 A PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Statistics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline is required.
 Experience with computational analysis, algorithm development, statistics and machine learning.
 Proficiency in at least one modern programming language. Experience with a scientific programming environment, such as python, R or Matlab, is preferred.

The Management and Monitoring Intern assists The Nature Conservancy with aspects of science and restoration activities on The Disney Wilderness Preserve. The Intern works with biologists, land managers and volunteers to control and map invasive plants, monitor and manage wildlife species and natural communities, conduct hydrological data collection in swamps and other wetlands, and participate in prescribed fires. This position will be based at The Nature Conservancy’s Disney Wilderness Preserve, an 11,500-acre fire-managed high quality conservation site near Kissimmee Florida. The intern will be provided with training on prescribed fire, monitoring and restoration techniques, and the use of GIS software and GPS units.


Location Description
Home to more than 1,000 species of plants and animals, The Disney Wilderness Preserve is an essential part of the Everglades ecosystem and contains 3,500 acres of restored wetlands that act as nature’s “sponges” in the landscape capturing rain, filtering out nutrients and replenishing our ground water.
The core of The Disney Wilderness Preserve is comprised of what was once an 8,500-acre cattle ranch situated at the head of the Greater Everglades watershed. In the early 1990s, the ranch was slated for extensive residential and commercial development which would have spelled the end for the property’s degraded—but restorable—wetlands, as well as the destruction of significant habitat for endangered plants and wildlife.

Our lab is currently located at the Max Planck Florida Institute, and the lab is moving to the Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/) in the summer of 2019.

Essential Duties & Responsibilities
Our goal is to understand basic principles of neural circuit plasticity and how it influences cognitive brain functions and complex behaviors. The project will be performed by synapse, circuit, and behavior levels. We have considerable expertise in the study of cellular mechanisms governing neural circuit development in which we mainly use electrophysiology and laser-based cutting-edge techniques such as two-photon imaging and photolysis of caged neurotransmitters (Kwon and Sabatini, Nature, 2011; Kwon et al, Nature Neuroscience, 2012; Oh et al, Science, 2016). In addition, our lab recently developed new optogenetic approaches (named iTango2 and Cal-Light) to label and control behaviorally-relevant neuronal circuits in behaving animals (Lee D et al, Nature Methods, 2017; Lee D et al, Nature Biotechnology, 2017). Using these tools, we plan to dissect circuit modules underlying complex cognitive behaviors and ultimately engineer or falsify memories of animals. Several ongoing projects monitors neuronal activities in behaving animals by two-photon imaging, in vivo miniscope, electrophysiology, and fiber photometry. Together with all these cutting-edge imaging techniques, we are routinely dissect neuronal circuitry by viral tracing, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations, two-photon uncaging, and single cell/synapse resolution imaging with newly developed technology from our lab. In addition, several novel techniques that are useful for circuit dissections are currently under development.

565,"The National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) seeks to recruit a visionary and leader to serve as our Director of Information Technology.
About the NWTF
The NWTF is a national nonprofit organization ' is the leader in upland wildlife habitat conservation in North America. No other organization in the world has committed more time and effort into the preservation of the American wild turkey and our hunting heritage.
Our History
On March 28, 1973, the Commonwealth of Virginia issued incorporation papers to a fledgling organization in Fredericksburg called the National Wild Turkey Federation. The NWTF is headquartered in Edgefield, South Carolina, and has local chapters in every state.
The NWTF has come a long way since its founding chief executive, Tom Rodgers, took $440 out of his own pocket to put this organization in motion.
And what it has turned into is nothing short of phenomenal.
Who Are We?
We are sportsmen, women and children who care deeply about our natural resources and the wild places we love to hunt.
We cherish the memory of the ridge top gobbler we hunted last spring and fondly remember the cornfield where we saw that big buck at sunset two years ago.
Collectively, we come from all walks of life to engage in conservation and preserve the hunting heritage we all hold dear.
We're hunters...
Some of us follow bird dogs through waving stands of grass from South Georgia to Montana in pursuit of bobwhite quail and pheasant.
And most of us would rather spend a bitterly cold winter morning knee deep in a flooded oak flat or beaver pond than waste that morning in a warm bed.
... champions of conservation.
According to many state and federal agencies, the restoration of the wild turkey is arguably the greatest conservation success story in North America's wildlife history. When the NWTF was founded in 1973, there were about 1.5 million wild turkeys in North America. After decades of dedicated work, that number hit a historic high of almost 7 million turkeys.
Through vital partnerships with state, federal and provincial wildlife agencies, the NWTF and our members have helped restore wild turkey populations throughout North America, facilitating the investment of $488 million to conserve more than 17 million acres of habitat.
That area is larger than the state of West Virginia.
Wild turkeys and hundreds of other species of upland wildlife, including quail, deer, grouse, pheasant and songbirds, have benefited from this improved habitat.
Our dedicated volunteers bring new hunters and conservationists into the fold ' about 100,000 every year ' through outdoor education events and our Women in the Outdoors, Wheelin' Sportsmen and JAKES youth outreach programs.
We are recognized as the undisputed leader in conservation habitat work, an unwavering advocate of hunters' rights and the visionary organization who has the solution for the future of hunting and conservation.
Protecting Our Hunting Heritage
Hunters and shooters fuel conservation by providing funds for federal and state wildlife agencies through license sales and voluntary excise taxes on firearms and ammunition. A loss in hunter numbers results in a drop in funding for conservation.
The NWTF has a long history of removing regulatory barriers to hunting and is invested in preserving hunters' rights. Few organizations do more to recruit and mentor new hunters than the NWTF.
A fierce commitment to preserving our hunting traditions is one of the key principles that guide the NWTF and its volunteers. It has helped make the NWTF a driving force in the protection of North America's richest and most treasured traditions.
The Federation strives each day to ensure wild turkeys and other wildlife are afforded the best opportunity to thrive. Our work on the ground is unparalleled because of our passion to conserve the nation's rich natural resources so that generations to come can enjoy them as we do today.
Our mission has inspired countless volunteers and partners to stand with us to promote upland habitat conservation and the outdoor traditions we hold dear. Hunters, anglers, birders, biologists, land managers, wildlife professionals, and foresters: These are a few who comprise the NWTF and fuel our efforts to keep wild turkeys and other wildlife flourishing and our ability to hunt them unchallenged.
The National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) seeks to recruit a visionary and strategic leader to serve as our Director of Information Technology.

What are the Squads?
Depending on your experience and what you are passionate about, you can expect to work across the following:
Backend Squads
Our data pipelines are primarily Java-based, with documents making their way through Cassandra, Spark, before arriving into graph databases and Elastic Search. We also ingest significant amounts of structured data on chemistry and biology from structured databases, such as ChEMBL.
There’s some significant complexity in our data-processing pipeline, so we’re interested in measuring, monitoring, acceptance testing and performance tuning.
We’re enthusiastic adopters of GraphQL which ties all our data and APIs together.
Machine Learning Squads
We primarily write in Python, using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras for machine learning. We implement cutting-edge research from recent papers with these libraries, as well as producing our own novel research through relationship extraction (RE), named entity recognition (NER) and data pipelining.
NER and RE, you can also say Information Extraction (IE) turns documents from external sources (articles, patents, abstracts etc.) into new edges in our unstructured graph that represent a relation between two entities. Connecting the dots and identifying relationships powers our AI tools.
In particular we apply good engineering practices to the data-preprocessing stages of our machine learning stages, using PySpark for data processing, and systems such as dvc for storing versioned data and models.
Frontend Squads
We have built various interesting applications for our chemical and biological users which include:
Presenting information in our knowledge graph.
Triggering AI models and triaging predictions.
Gathering scientific feedback.
Designing new molecules.
Sometimes we need to build production-quality frontends, other times we quickly prototype interesting ideas to develop. We build unified API to access our Knowledge Graph and other services.
We make the most of modern frontend tech, including Angular6, Typescript/ES6, RxJS, Flux Pattern, SASS and Material Design. We have in-house UX and Design to make our applications useful and breathtaking.
Deployment Squads
We deploy everything to Kubernetes and RiseML. We manage our own clusters, as well as spinning up additional compute capacity on AWS.
Our in-house-cluster is also home to our Nvidia DGX-1 Deep Learning Supercomputer, which we use to analyse billions of currently theoretical molecules.

Specifically, this work addresses current and emerging risks associated with fish diseases, prevalence of pathogens, and associated host response(s) (i.e., immunological changes), environmental variables that affect the disease status of fish populations, and the potential effects of disease status on human populations as it relates to zoonotic fish pathogens. This position will provide epidemiological support when needed to minimize health risks, improve biosecurity protocols, and collect health-based samples involving live fish and provide comprehensive health assessments for fish populations.

This position will conduct surveillance for regulated and reportable pathogens to meet the requirements of the Salmonid Disease Control Policy of the Co-Managers of Washington State (Policy); monitor hatchery populations for zoonotic and non-zoonotic fish pathogens; provide directions to Fish Program staff and aquaculturists regarding compliance with the Policy; and as it relates to the diagnosis of diseases and their treatments with prescribed therapeutants or Veterinary Feed Directives (VFDs), under the direction of the Veterinary of Record (VOR). This position is expected to collaborate with veterinarians and other Fish Health Pathologists employed by WDFW, Washington Departments of Agriculture and Health, with tribal co-managers, federal government (USDA-APHIS-VS, USFWS, USGS, and NOAA), and with universities, and will maintain open communication with appropriate federal, state, and tribal agencies concerning public health, when necessary.

The BMD TAH is accountable to the BMD line function leadership team for development and implementation of “fit for purpose” biomarker strategies and providing an effective interface for advancing projects through later stage Development. The BMD TAH leads, through matrix reporting, a dedicated BMD line function subject matter expert (SME) team and a group of TA Biomarker Experts (BME) to advance a broad portfolio of projects. Translational Medicine
Translational Medicine is a global team of physician-scientists and researchers specializing in integrating findings from early drug discovery projects with their own deep knowledge of disease pathways and unmet medical needs. They offer insights on where a novel therapy might have the highest impact on diseases and what research needs to be done prior to clinical testing.
The group has adopted an open and flexible approach to maximize impact on projects. Rather than committing a candidate to one disease area early on, they carry out studies in multiple small, focused patient populations. They then follow the science to identify patient groups who show the most promising therapeutic response. Often this leads to the exploration of rare diseases that are genetically well defined and have few effective treatment options.

990,"Dr. Nicholas Schork, Director of Quantitative Medicine at TGen, seeks a creative, independent, and highly motivated researcher interested in developing and applying novel and comprehensive annotation methods for genes and genetic variants in a wide variety of contexts, in particular disease diagnosis, therapeutic choice and cross-species (orthology) disease model analyses. The methods to be developed will consider modeling the influence of genetic variants on gene function and the functional effects of genes that can be reconciled across species.

Detailed Description
Brief Professional Activities Description
The post-doctoral fellow will have the opportunity to develop and evaluate computationally-based gene and genetic variant functional models in a collaborative environment that includes basic scientists, computational and quantitative scientists, biomedical technology developers, evolutionary biologists and clinicians, including those at TGen's affiliated institution, the City of Hope Hospital in East Los Angeles, as well as its many other partner institutions.

Variant functional annotation and orthology assessment methods are being developed rapidly. In addition, databases harboring information about the likely influence of genes and genetic variants in pathway and network contexts exist and continually being refined (e.g., the GTEX databases). Finally, large-scale functional studies using emerging model systems and in vitro assays such as CRISPR screens are being pursued to generate information that needs to be mined and reconciled. The challenge will be to integrate all of this into more comprehensive models of gene function and leverage them to make claims about the health status of individuals, the likely benefits of specific gene-targeting therapeutics, and the utility of specific model systems to understand disease pathogenesis. In this context, the proposed activity and research will involve:
Modeling and the influence of genetic variants on gene expression, protein structure and function, splicing, and other molecular physiologic processes
Considering the combined influence of multiple genetic variants on gene function
Developing models that consider compensatory and feedback mechanisms in networks and biological processes
Developing methods that leverage sequence orthology and homology across different species to assess function
Contributing to the development of software and webtools that implement the models to be developed
Participating in the implementation and evaluation of the application of the models to be developed
Present the models at major conferences and in peer-reviewed publications
TGen has access to some of the largest and fastest computing systems in the world that can be leveraged in the proposed research. In addition, the development of the proposed models will likely have a broad, international impact, given the amount of attention genetics and genomics research is receiving, so the research to be pursued will be highly visible and competitive, and as a result could propel the career of an independently-minded researcher looking to make an indelible impact on a biomedical science.
Job Requirements
Ph.D. (completed or near completion) in Bioinformatics, Systems Biology, Computational or Quantitative Biology, Biostatistics, Comparative Biology, or a related field.
Computer programming, R, scripting languages, and biological database query skills
Familiarity with genomics and comparative biology
Experience with large biological data sets
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Willingness to work in collaborative settings
No publication record is required, but a publication track record is preferred
