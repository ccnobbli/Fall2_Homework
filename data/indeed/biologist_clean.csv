Scientist - Cryo Electron Microscopy,position summary     known for its scientific and operational excellence regeneron is a leading sciencebased biopharmaceutical company that discovers invents develops manufactures and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions regeneron commercializes medicines for eye diseases high ldlcholesterol atopic dermatitis and a rare inflammatory condition and has product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need including rheumatoid arthritis asthma pain cancer and infectious diseases          summary     we are seeking a phdlevel scientist to join our growing structural biology group this position will focus exclusively on cryoelectron microscopy of molecules in regenerons drug development pipeline including membrane proteins large multiprotein assemblies and antibodytarget complexes this is a tremendous opportunity for an individual to contribute to projects of real medical impact as well as help establish cryoelectron microscopy as a tool to drive regenerons research forward          responsibilities     this work will involve many of the stages of a structural biology project from protein characterization and complex purification to em grid preparation negative stain and cryoelectron microscopy data collection data processing structure determination and refinement earlierstage work such as cloning protein expression and protein purification will be carried out by other groups at regeneron but our group will remain involved in these stages eg when special constructs are required for the structural work          although the goal of our efforts will be to produce highresolution cryoem structures it will be important to generate results for the project at each stage of the process from initial micrographs to negative stain 2d and 3d reconstructions to lowresolution cryoem maps many projects will benefit greatly even if a nearatomic resolution structure is not possible          at the moment and for the near future we are traveling to external imaging facilities and using their microscopes to collect our data however we will install our own titan krios at regeneron in late 2019 providing nearly unlimited time for data collection on a state of the art microscope one of the main responsibilities of this position will be to ensure that this microscope is used productively by generating enough cryoem samples to feed the beast and by processing and analyzing the resulting data the group is small enough that we will not have a dedicated person to maintain the microscope so all group members will be responsible for routine maintenance and alignment with a service contract in place for more significant repairs          this position will be highly collaborative interacting with scientists in all areas of regeneron rd and beyond the person hired for this job will need to understand complex research projects involving many different scientific areas contribute in project meetings to shape the direction of the research clearly communicate their structural results to an audience of nonstructural biologists and direct the course of their own work without extensive supervision          licb1          requirements     this position requires a minimum of a phd in structural biology with the thesis research being mostly or completely focused on protein cryoelectron microscopy research on an integrated structural biology project combining cryoem with other techniques is acceptable as long as cryoem was at the core of the project and represents the majority of the work performed          24 years of postdoctoral experience in protein cryoem or closely related fields eg cryoelectron tomography is also highly desirable          experience in other structural biology disciplines such as xray crystallography or protein nmr is helpful but cannot substitute for the cryoem experience          since this position will be handson in the lab a substantial amount of experience purifying and characterizing proteins is also necessary          the successful candidate must have a demonstrated track record of independent research including one or more firstauthor publications          this position will involve work on many different projects simultaneously so excellent recordkeeping and time management skills are very important as well as the ability to absorb new information rapidly the candidate must be able to work collaboratively with scientists from different backgrounds and be able to explain their results clearly and concisely to many different audiences most of whom will have little or no experience in structural biology          it will be very helpful if the candidate has some direct experience maintaining and aligning electron microscopes as we have no facility manager and will need to carry out these tasks ourselves along with a service contract from the manufacturer          this is an opportunity to join our select team that is already leading the way in the pharmaceuticalbiotech industry apply today and learn more about regenerons unwavering commitment to combining good science  good business          to all agencies please no phone calls or emails to any employee of regeneron about this opening all resumes submitted by search firmsemployment agencies to any employee at regeneron viaemail the internet or in any form andor method will be deemed the sole property of regeneron unless such search firmsemployment agencies were engaged by regeneron for this position and a valid agreement with regeneron is in place in the event a candidate who was submitted outside of the regeneron agency engagement process is hired no fee or payment of any kind will be paid

engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress     we want to learn fast but build for the longterm we want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades or even centuries     stay close to the real problems we engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our societys challenges like those who live them every day          our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can

our hunting heritage     hunters and shooters fuel conservation by providing funds for federal and state wildlife agencies through license sales and voluntary excise taxes on firearms and ammunition a loss in hunter numbers results in a drop in funding for conservation     the nwtf has a long history of removing regulatory barriers to hunting and is invested in preserving hunters rights few organizations do more to recruit and mentor new hunters than the nwtf     a fierce commitment to preserving our hunting traditions is one of the key principles that guide the nwtf and its volunteers
