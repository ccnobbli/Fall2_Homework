business analyst job posting and thought that sounds great but what is this job actually like then keep reading          the core function of our role as business analysts at grant street group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients and this requires us to wear many different hats          so what do all of these hats really mean     problem solving every day you work to solve

on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively     client support when a customer has a question problem or suggestion they come to you you are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly whether the issue is major or minor you know that grant street group takes software as a service literally     prioritization our software is everchanging with that comes the need to prioritize what when and how changes are made since youre working with the software and our clients daily who better to prioritize than you business analysts are constantly asking themselves does this feature need to be completed before a certain time what is the impact of this bug how can other clients benefit from this change we use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes we then prioritize them for developers to work on     technical specifications its your job to convey to the

specification does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly     implementations were a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth since youre a subject matter expert you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs think of yourself as a consultant what business processes does the client need to accomplish how can our software fit in with and help that process     training helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role whether its a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process youre a resource for providing the information and tools they need     does this sound exciting and

always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard     before you begin the interview process keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that
