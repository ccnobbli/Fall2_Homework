Software Development Engineer: International Preferences,"job description
amazoncoms longterm vision is to enable a seamless experience for all amazon customers worldwide on any amazon website and device in any language and for any culture this extends the personalization of the shopping experience by allowing our customers to define their preferred language and currency and ensure that we provide an equivalent experience for our customers in their language of preference as we do customers in the default marketplace language

our team started in early 2014 and as of july 2018 we have launched multiple languages in 4 different marketplaces us canada japan and germany our goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces we believe that by establishing a core libraries and services and providing tools and mechanisms we can broadly influence change across amazons while and auditing the quality of our customer experiences

about you
youre looking for a career where youll be able to build to deliver and to impress you look at problems holistically and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems you want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space you challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions this highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical business and customer experience goals youll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the amazon retail as a whole  from algorithmic innovation all the way down to the datasets that the backend services consume

about us together
were going to change the way that amazon thinks about supporting our global customer along the way were going to face seemingly impossible problems were going to argue about how to solve them and well work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with well make tough decisions but well all understand why well be the dream team

the ideal engineer for this space will be highly quantitative have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience be inventive and have a strong track record of delivery you also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams

some problem spaces well be working on

language and currency platform  we need to develop a platform and provide library support for the amazon developer community that simplify development for our international customer and provide a unified experience regardless of their location and preference we will be instrumental in defining the standards and approaches used broadly across amazon and developing mechanisms that will audit our customer experience ensuring that we can identify and address any measurable deviation this platform and the libraries must support our mobile and desktop initiatives and must also be futureproofed to enable amazon to continuously innovate

language release  today releasing a language on an amazon marketplace and we want to simplify this to be a simple configuration switch so there is a large gap to bridge ultimately our goal is to reduce the investment necessary such that business owners can ultimately selfserve and release languages as machine translations are available we need to design a robust and scalable solution that can be adapted to the local marketplace needs while maintaining a consistent quality bar across amazon

datamart  as we release new languages across marketplaces our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces ideally we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses as such we need to create a datamart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered as we create the datamart we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling at the scale of amazons global retail business and employ bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data we will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster should the need arise consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information

customer experience  as arbiters of the customer experience we need to understand our customers experience in their languages of preference similarly given the scope of this initiative it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release as a result it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations both coverage and quality throughout their journey within the amazon marketplace this is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience furthermore in real time and with zero latency we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions this is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest bigdata streaming technologies to provide a realtime data and measurement pipeline

audit  we must put our customers first and foremost and develop mechanisms to drive and audit their multilingual experience while we understand that the multilingual experience today has many gaps we need to respect our customers and rapidly iterate to close these gaps and all the while measuring the impact to our customers we will collaborate with the business teams to define the prioritization of features to be localized and provide metrics that make these prioritization decisions data driven
