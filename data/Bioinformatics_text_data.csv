341,"Temporary, ContractRecently, exciting developments at Genentech and elsewhere have demonstrated the potential of leveraging the human immune system for effective and durable control of cancer. Genentech seeks a talented and highly motivated scientist to pursue post-doctoral research projects — jointly in collaboration with Richard Bourgon, in our Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Department, and with Shannon Turley, in our Cancer Immunology Department — and to contribute to the identification and development of the next generation of immune-based cancer therapies.

Candidates should possess strong experience with both computational and experimental techniques for studying the genetics and molecular biology of cancer. Experience investigating the immune system’s response to cancer is preferred though not required.

Ideally, candidates will independently identify a specific direction of research, though in broad terms, we expect projects to focus on the generation and interpretation of high-throughput genomic and other molecular data that increase our understanding of, for example,

The degree and nature of immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME);
Mechanisms by which tumors avoid immune surveillance or inhibit effector activity;
The impact of mutation or gene expression dysregulation on tumor neo-antigen presentation; or
Local or circulating biomarkers which predict response to immunomodulatory drugs or therapies. It would be of particular interest for future clinical work to establish correlations between aspects of the TME and cytokine or other measurements made in the periphery, as this would enable high-frequency longitudinal monitoring of disease or response to therapy.

Emphasis is on basic research, though on topics with eventual relevance to the clinic and to Genentech’s drug and biomarker development initiatives.

Of note, Genentech’s extensive high-dimensional molecular characterization of samples from immunotherapy clinical trials provide an outstanding opportunity for integrating pre-clinical and clinical findings.

A successful candidate will work with interdisciplinary teams, carry out experimental data generation, analysis and integration across various domains, and apply best-in-class algorithms — or develop new algorithms — that directly address the motivating biological and/or clinical questions.

Research projects are expected to lead to first-author publications in high-quality journals.

370,"The Boni Lab in the Department of Biology at The Pennsylvania State University is recruiting a highly-motivated Postdoctoral Scholar to work on several key public health questions using large-scale individual-based malaria simulations. Our lab is based at the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at the Pennsylvania State University (University Park Campus), and we collaborate with partners based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit. The Postdoctoral Scholar will be funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Malaria Modeling Consortium (MMC), and the research will be integrated into MMC activities that currently include five institutions: Penn State, Institute for Disease Modeling, Oxford, Swiss Tropical Institute, and Imperial College. The first malaria questions to be investigated will be: whether the deployment of multiple first-line antimalarial therapies delays the onset of drug resistance; whether delaying drug resistance benefits other malaria control strategies; and whether drug-resistance evolution patterns differ by geographic settings. Specifically, we will be looking at recent changes in first-line therapy in Cambodia and the effect these may have on P. falciparum evolution in the 2020s. The background for the first aim is described in this 2008 paper in PNAS and this 2015 paper in Lancet Global Health. The analyses for the second and third aims are currently being developed. Software development for the malaria microsimulation began in 2010. The main goals of this project will be to continue development and validation of the malaria microsimulation, in order to: add detailed geographic structure and create scenarios where the simulation can be run as a ‘country model’, with the first countries of interest being Cambodia, Burkina Faso, Zambia, and Uganda; add more detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics models that are more representative of the true action of drugs on parasites; determine how best to prepare for an event where artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites are introduced into Africa, where hundreds of millions of people rely on life-saving artemisinin drugs; and optimize the future introduction of antimalarial drugs that will be available after 2020. Candidates are encouraged to apply if they are interested in these questions and interested in developing their own new directions in the computational epidemiology of malaria. The position requires strong knowledge of the C++ programming language. The position requires a PhD in one of Ecology, Evolution, Computational Epidemiology, Mathematical Modeling, Population Genetics, Bioinformatics, Applied Mathematics, or a related field.

609,"Dr. Nicholas Schork, Director of Quantitative Medicine at TGen, seeks a creative, independent, and highly motivated researcher interested in developing and applying novel and comprehensive annotation methods for genes and genetic variants in a wide variety of contexts, in particular disease diagnosis, therapeutic choice and cross-species (orthology) disease model analyses. The methods to be developed will consider modeling the influence of genetic variants on gene function and the functional effects of genes that can be reconciled across species.

Detailed Description
Brief Professional Activities Description
The post-doctoral fellow will have the opportunity to develop and evaluate computationally-based gene and genetic variant functional models in a collaborative environment that includes basic scientists, computational and quantitative scientists, biomedical technology developers, evolutionary biologists and clinicians, including those at TGen's affiliated institution, the City of Hope Hospital in East Los Angeles, as well as its many other partner institutions.

Variant functional annotation and orthology assessment methods are being developed rapidly. In addition, databases harboring information about the likely influence of genes and genetic variants in pathway and network contexts exist and continually being refined (e.g., the GTEX databases). Finally, large-scale functional studies using emerging model systems and in vitro assays such as CRISPR screens are being pursued to generate information that needs to be mined and reconciled. The challenge will be to integrate all of this into more comprehensive models of gene function and leverage them to make claims about the health status of individuals, the likely benefits of specific gene-targeting therapeutics, and the utility of specific model systems to understand disease pathogenesis. In this context, the proposed activity and research will involve:
Modeling and the influence of genetic variants on gene expression, protein structure and function, splicing, and other molecular physiologic processes
Considering the combined influence of multiple genetic variants on gene function
Developing models that consider compensatory and feedback mechanisms in networks and biological processes
Developing methods that leverage sequence orthology and homology across different species to assess function
Contributing to the development of software and webtools that implement the models to be developed
Participating in the implementation and evaluation of the application of the models to be developed
Present the models at major conferences and in peer-reviewed publications
TGen has access to some of the largest and fastest computing systems in the world that can be leveraged in the proposed research. In addition, the development of the proposed models will likely have a broad, international impact, given the amount of attention genetics and genomics research is receiving, so the research to be pursued will be highly visible and competitive, and as a result could propel the career of an independently-minded researcher looking to make an indelible impact on a biomedical science.
Job Requirements
Ph.D. (completed or near completion) in Bioinformatics, Systems Biology, Computational or Quantitative Biology, Biostatistics, Comparative Biology, or a related field.

931,"Job Description
Amazon.com's long-term vision is to enable a seamless experience for all Amazon customers worldwide on any Amazon website and device, in any language and for any culture. This extends the personalization of the shopping experience by allowing our customers to define their preferred language and currency and ensure that we provide an equivalent experience for our customers in their language of preference as we do customers in the default marketplace language.

Our team started in early 2014 and, as of July 2018, we have launched multiple languages in 4 different marketplaces (US, Canada, Japan and Germany). Our goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces. We believe that, by establishing a core libraries and services and providing tools and mechanisms, we can broadly influence change across Amazon's while and auditing the quality of our customer experiences.

About you:
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Amazon Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:
We're going to change the way that Amazon thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal engineer for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

LANGUAGE AND CURRENCY PLATFORM - we need to develop a platform and provide library support for the Amazon developer community that simplify development for our International customer and provide a unified experience, regardless of their location and preference. We will be instrumental in defining the standards and approaches used broadly across Amazon and developing mechanisms that will audit our customer experience ensuring that we can identify and address any measurable deviation. This platform and the libraries must support our mobile and desktop initiatives and must also be future-proofed to enable Amazon to continuously innovate.

LANGUAGE RELEASE - today releasing a language on an Amazon marketplace and we want to simplify this to be a simple configuration switch, so there is a large gap to bridge. Ultimately, our goal is to reduce the investment necessary such that business owners can ultimately self-serve and release languages as machine translations are available. We need to design a robust and scalable solution that can be adapted to the local marketplace needs while maintaining a consistent quality bar across Amazon.

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of Amazon's global retail business) and employ BigData techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Amazon marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest BigData streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

AUDIT - we must put our customers first and foremost and develop mechanisms to drive and audit their multilingual experience. While we understand that the multilingual experience today has many gaps, we need to respect our customers and rapidly iterate to close these gaps and, all the while, measuring the impact to our customers. We will collaborate with the business teams to define the prioritization of features to be localized and provide metrics that make these prioritization decisions data driven.

946,"Berkeley Lab’s Molecular Biophysics & Integrated Bioimaging Division has an immediate opening for an XFEL (X-ray Free-Electron Laser) Computational Crystallographer Postdoctoral Fellow. The next decade of structural biology at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) will include groundbreaking advances in time domain protein crystallography, diffuse scattering to observe dynamic motion, and single particle diffraction, and we are developing the data-centered computational methods that will make these advances possible.

What You Will Do:
Serial crystallography datasets carry many challenges, in particular the sheer volume of data, and the special treatment required for still-shot Bragg reflections. We are seeking a scientist with strong physical and mathematical intuition who can formulate and code the appropriate algorithms for data processing, and who has the patience and drive to deal with the many experimental uncertainties and sources of noise. The successful candidate will join a team of developers focused on software for new science, building on a strong pre-existing software foundation, including the DIALS and cctbx.xfel toolkits created here (http://cci.lbl.gov/publications/nick_sauter.html).
One focus area is photosystem II, using a combination of time-resolved XFEL-based crystallography and X-ray emission spectroscopy to elucidate the sequence of redox events leading to the release of molecular oxygen. Our Division is involved in all aspects of the project, including experimental design and construction, data collection, software development, and crystallographic analysis. Another critical area is the examination of other metalloenzymes such as nitrogenase. Crystallography can spatially resolve the absorption edges from distinct metal centers in the catalytic cofactors, and the absorption spectrum will inform us about the electronic environment and valence states of the atoms. XFELs afford us time resolution, and assure the absence of radiation damage, but the anomalous differences must be quantified to better than 1%, thus creating a need for a unique, new software approach.
The projects are funded by a combination of NIH and DOE sources. We also have an ongoing DOE-funded collaboration with SLAC, to scale up the crystallography data analysis pipeline to petascale supercomputers here at NERSC, and eventually to exascale servers in the next decade. This is a great chance for personal growth in a highly collaborative environment, but candidates should come well prepared with a working knowledge of Python and C++, and attendant problem-solving skills.

What is Required:
PhD in Biophysics, Bioinformatics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or Physical Sciences.
Familiarity with macromolecular crystallography, other structural biology techniques, or image processing methods.
Python and C++ both mandatory.
Experience with modern object-oriented, version-controlled software development, with a team-oriented approach.
Excellent oral and written communication skills.
Ability to work effectively as part of a cross-disciplinary team.
Demonstrated ability to analyze complex problems with direct supervision, develop strategies to solve specific problems, while running appropriate controls to validate the correct results.

The posting shall remain open until the position is filled.

Notes:
This is a full time, 2 years, postdoctoral appointment with the possibility of renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds and ongoing operational needs. You must have less than 3 years paid postdoctoral experience. Salary for Postdoctoral positions depends on years of experience post-degree.
Full-time, M-F, exempt (monthly paid) from overtime pay.
Salary will be predetermined based on postdoctoral step rates.
This position may be subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment.

973,"ContractPROJECT SUMMARY:
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in mitochondrial signaling in type 2 diabetes (T2D) at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, California (San Francisco Bay Area).
This is a full time position with an initial one-year contract that can be extended.
The project uses pancreatic β-cell physiology assaying and top-down analysis of bioenergetic parameters measured using fluorescence microscopy and Seahorse respirometry to uncover causes of beta cell failure in T2D. Therefore both strong wet-bench and data analysis skills are required.
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Altered cellular energetics and related cellular signaling contribute to human disease in general and physiological aging and chronic diseases in particular, including cancer, neurodegeneration, ischemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial metabolism also plays a central role in insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. When glucose is elevated, the increased metabolism results in a substantial mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, as well as in increased rates of ATP synthesis and turnover marked by faster cell respiration. The project uses microscale bioenergetic assaying of human primary β-cell cultures, assessment of β-cell physiology and top-down analysis of cellular energy metabolism. The project investigates the molecular pathways that make healthy β- cell bioenergetics – and insulin secretion – normally highly responsive to glucose, and pathways that may fail in type 2 diabetes. Relevant papers from our lab to this project are: PMIDs 26204464, 27404273, 27771512.
The successful candidate will receive training in the particular experimental technologies used in this project, will design and conduct experiments and analyze data. The postdoc is expected to lead his/her own project, write up and present results.
ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS:
PhD in biological or biomedical sciences, bioengineering or bioinformatics
Solid knowledge of cell and mitochondrial metabolism
Cell culturing experience
Wet bench experience
Proven publication record
Strong written and oral communication skills
Ability to prioritize and manage own time
Ability to work independently and also capable of interacting successfully within a group.
DESIRED SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE:
Cell or mitochondrial respirometry
Fluorescence microscopy
Experience in β-cell physiology or in diabetes
Experience in metabolic modeling
Experience in RNAi methods

Our employees create the Providence Experience through simple, caring behaviors such as acknowledging and welcoming each visitor, introducing ourselves and Providence, addressing people by name, providing the duration of estimated wait times and updating frequently if timelines change, explaining situations in a way that puts patients at ease, carefully listening to their concerns, and always thanking people for trusting Providence for their healthcare needs. At Providence, our quality vision is simple,
""Providence will provide the best care and service to every person, every time.""
